<h2 class="nobreak" id="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_THIRTY-FIRST">ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FIRST ANNUAL
MEETING OF THE PENNSYLVANIA
PRISON SOCIETY</h2>
</div>


<p>The 131st Annual Meeting of THE PENNSYLVANIA
PRISON SOCIETY was held at the office of the Society in the
Forrest Building, 119 South Fourth Street, Philadelphia, on the
afternoon of January 11, 1918, President Edw. M. Wistar in the
Chair.</p>

<p>Twenty-two members were present.</p>

<p>The minutes of the 130th Meeting were read and approved.</p>

<p>The Report of the Acting Committee for the year 1917 was
read by the Secretary. It was approved and directed to be
printed in the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>. (See pages 6-12.)</p>

<p>The Treasurer, John Way, presented a detailed statement of
the receipts and payments for the fiscal year ending December
31, 1917, accompanied by a schedule of the securities held for the
Society by the fiscal agent, The Provident Life and Trust Company.
The report has been duly audited and was accepted. (See
page 13.)</p>

<p>On behalf of the Committee on Nominations, the Secretary
presented a list of nominations for the Officers of the Society,
and for members of the Acting Committee to succeed those whose
terms expire on February 1. The election being duly held, the
persons nominated were elected to the offices designated in the
report of the Committee. (See page 3.)</p>

<p>The Secretary informed the meeting that a number of county
prisons were profiting by an Act, introduced to the attention of
the Assembly by the State Board of Charities and which was
promptly passed, making it possible for prisoners confined in the
county jails to be released to work on land owned by the county.
Eight counties report that some of their inmates have been working
on farms and that the results have been very satisfactory.
Fifteen counties have the subject under consideration with a view
of trying the experiment next season. The law was approved
in July, 1917, hence there was little time to organize for the growing
season of last year. Independently of this law, the Court in
a few counties had granted special parole to some selected prisoners
so that they might be employed on farms either on land owned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
by the county or on land belonging to parties who assumed the
responsibility of caring for the paroled prisoners.</p>

<p>Regret was expressed that a bill designed to amend the law
providing for the Indeterminate Sentence, so that its provisions
would correspond more nearly to its title, failed to secure executive
sanction.</p>

<p>To nominate the Officers at the next Annual Meeting, the
President appointed Rev. J. F. Ohl, Austin C. Leeds, Marriott
C. Morris, Mrs. Mary S. Grigg and Mrs. Eliza M. Cope.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="REPORT_OF_ACTING_COMMITTEE_FOR_THE_YEAR_1917">REPORT OF ACTING COMMITTEE FOR THE YEAR 1917</h2>
</div>


<p>All the stated meetings of the Acting Committee for the year
1917 have been regularly held with an average attendance of
about 16 members. We are gratified to report this apparent increase
of interest, indicated by a larger attendance than for several
years past. We are entirely aware that several of our very
efficient members have business engagements which make frequent
attendance impossible. It must also be remembered that
some of our members reside at a distance from the city. The
presence of 10 members have constituted a quorum, and no meeting
has been held without the number required for the legal transaction
of business.</p>


<p class="ph4">LEGISLATION.</p>

<p>The General Assembly of 1917 was notable for activity and
interest in reformatory legislation. The Acting Committee favored
and urged the passage of several measures, some of which
have become law in this Commonwealth.</p>

<p>An Act providing that any person held for costs or fines
may, at the discretion of the Court, be released, on agreeing to
pay the said charges by instalments, was passed by the Assembly
and received the sanction of the Governor.</p>

<p>An Act providing for the establishment of six industrial
farms, to which persons sentenced for the shorter sentences in
the county jails may be sent, amended by the substitution of nine
instead of six, was passed and received executive sanction.</p>

<p>An Act, urged by the Prison Reform League, and which received
our hearty sanction, providing for the appointment of a
commission of five persons to investigate prison systems in this
commonwealth and elsewhere, and to recommend such revision<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
of the existing prison system as may be deemed wise, for adoption
by the next General Assembly, was passed and approved by
the Governor.</p>

<p>An Act, proposed by the State Board of Charities, providing
that prisoners may be released from county prisons to work
on farms belonging to the State or county was passed and received
the approval of the Governor. This Act shall remain in
force during the continuance of the present war. Already several
counties have taken advantage of this Act to the satisfaction
of all parties concerned.</p>

<p>An Act, designed to render the present law more effective
with regard to the employment of prisoners in the manufacture
of articles for State use, we regret to report, perished in the Committee
room.</p>

<p>An Act to abolish Capital Punishment passed in the Senate
but failed of passage in the House.</p>

<p>An Act amending the present law in regard to the Indeterminate
Sentence, so that its provisions may more nearly harmonize
with its title, was approved by both Houses of the Assembly,
but was vetoed by the Governor.</p>

<p>While we are deeply gratified to report progress, we shall
continue our efforts to secure from the next Assembly favorable
action in regard to the measures which failed to become statutory
in 1917. Public sentiment is a plant of slow growth. Possibly
our propositions may have been defective in some particulars.
With some slight modification or embellishment, we believe all
the measures we have endorsed will soon have place among the
statutes of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>A synopsis of these measures with some explanation and
comment will be found elsewhere in the <span class="smcap">Journal</span> of which this
report forms a part.</p>

<p>We desire to acknowledge the valuable services of the Prison
Reform League in preparing bills and in conducting hearings before
the Committee of the Assembly.</p>


<p class="ph4">DISCHARGED PRISONERS.</p>

<p>The majority of the prisoners who are released from the
State Penal Institutions are dismissed on parole. They are
under supervision by the Parole Officers from a few months
to some years. Most of these paroled persons have some definite
place of employment in view. It may be supposed that
the operation of the law of parole has to a considerable extent
relieved this Society from former obligations in behalf of the
released prisoner. Admitting the value of this work of Parole,
we still have a mission for the discharged prisoners.</p>

<ol>
<li>Quite a number are discharged on their own recognizance.
We often assist these in securing employment and provide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
them with room and board until they have landed a job.</li>

<li>Many of them who secure employment in large establishments
must wait a fortnight or more before they receive
wages. We endeavor to care for them till the welcome pay day
has arrived. They are often destitute and also their families, so
that they find this assistance very acceptable in time of deepest
need.</li>

<li>In many employments, the workmen are required to
furnish their own tools. Here we have a constant service.</li>

<li>Quite frequently they leave the prison with no funds to
pay their transportation to their homes or to their places of employment.
We care for these necessities.</li>

<li>There is a service for those who are discharged at the
expiration of their sentence. If they desire aid, we are pleased
when they come directly to us from the prison, instead of waiting
till they are entirely destitute after spending their gate money.
It has been our purpose to ascertain in advance what they may
need and to be ready to offer a temporary home and satisfactory
employment.</li>

<li>Sometimes those who secure employment need for some
time the service of a physician. They are directed to a hospital,
and meanwhile they must have subsistence.</li>

<li>We are not able to escape some sense of responsibility
on behalf of the human derelicts who come to us with their piteous
story, whether true or false. They are feeble in mind, in
health, in will. They may have “wasted their substance in riotous
living.” We do not wish to believe they are wholly irreclaimable,
entirely past any hope of redemption. It is little we
do, or can do, for them. One of them died the other day at the
Philadelphia Hospital. Off and on for years he had tried our
patience. He would run well for a brief season, then a tremendous
fall from grace. Without a murmur or an apology, he
meekly endured the ebullition of our righteous wrath, and left
us professing good intentions fortified by the medicine of our
wholesome counsel. He said we were the only friends he had
in the days of his downfall. When in funds his friends showed
their appreciation of his generosity by aiding him in the distribution
of his pitifully small earnings. Did he recall in those
last days of asthmatic suffering our solemn warnings, our endeavors
to point the true way to happiness? While we do not
know, we however are unable to regret our poor efforts to restore
him to some sense of responsibility.</li>

<p>There is great need of a farm with some simple industry
attached to which these unfortunates may be consigned in order
to earn their own maintenance.</p>

<p class="ph4">VISITATION.</p>

<p>The Committees under appointment to visit the Eastern Penitentiary
and the County Prison of Philadelphia have presented
reports at each of our meetings. The summary of these reports
reveals much faithful labor on behalf of those who are behind
the bars.</p>

<p>These figures indicate activity, interest, sympathy, encouragement,
and yet they are inconclusive. That some hearts have
been touched, that some men and women have been reclaimed,
we do not doubt. The seed has been sown, and often it seems
like casting seed upon the waters. The men are here today and
they are gone tomorrow. Many of the interviews are brief and
are confined to a word of cheer or the ordinary greetings of the
day; at other times way opens to point to a better way of life.
Every year the efforts of some of the bearers of good tidings
result in accessions to the Church.</p>

<p>Members of our Committee have also visited the prisons
in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Doylestown, West Chester, Bellefonte,
Media, Allentown and York. Some of these prisons receive
regular visits and the reported results are gratifying.</p>

<p>Several Members of the Committee hold religious services
at our prisons.</p>


<p class="ph4">POLICE MATRONS.</p>

<p>Over thirty years ago, our Acting Committee began to urge
that matrons should be employed at the Police Stations in order
to care for the women and children who might be arrested or
who might ask for assistance. A few matrons were at first appointed
in some of the districts where there seemed to be especial
need of such help, but at this time nearly every Station House
in the city has secured the services of such an official.</p>

<p>Our Committee on Police Matrons constitute our delegation
to the Associated Committee of Women on Police Matrons,
an organization which meets in the offices of the Society on the
second Wednesday of each month. The members of this Association
make regular visits to the Matrons, and co-operate with
them in their work. They endeavor to secure improved accommodations
in the Stations and also to supply the immediate needs
of the unfortunate ones who are brought to these Stations either
for shelter or for trial. The following associations each send
three delegates to compose this body.</p>

<p class="ph4">MEETING OF WARDENS.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the Acting Committee, held September 20,
1917, the Secretary was authorized to issue invitations in co-operation
with The Prison Reform League to the wardens and
prison officials of the Eastern and Central counties of the Commonwealth
to hold a conference on the Glen Mills Farms on the
fourth and fifth of October. The consent of Supt. Nibecker, of
the Boys’ Department, and of Martha P. Falconer, Superintendent
of the Girls’ Department, had been previously obtained. The co-operation
of these two officials contributed largely to the success
of this meeting, which was the first of the kind held in the
State. It was attended by forty persons, a number which exceeded
our expectations. It was concluded to form a permanent
organization to meet annually and to discuss and formulate methods
of penal administration. A full account will be found in
the Annual Journal. (See pages 26-37.)</p>


<p class="ph4">EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS.</p>

<p>Your Acting Committee is favorable to every sane effort to
provide employment for prisoners. We have long contended
that idleness was the most conspicuous fault in the prisons of
this Commonwealth.</p>

<p>We believe in these times of stress that it is a flagrant fault
to waste an ounce of muscular effort. The conservation of all
our resources implies that the 400,000 now confined in the prisons
of the United States should be compelled not only to earn
their own maintenance but to contribute their fair share for the
urgent needs of the nation. They may be employed in the preparation
of surgical supplies, in canning fruit and vegetables, and
in a great variety of manufacturing industries. To this end we
give hearty support to a bill now pending in Congress providing
that the resources of all our penal institutions be utilized in
such a way that the country may derive the maximum benefit
from the labor of those behind the bars. Let them “do their bit.”
It will help both them and the general public. The executive
order of 1904 forbidding the use by the government of prison-made
goods or articles should at once be abrogated. Whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
reason may have been advanced at that time for such an order,
surely the present emergency demands every available resource
should be conserved.</p>


<p class="ph4">AMERICAN PRISON ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p>The meetings of this Association were held this year November
19-23 at New Orleans. There was a good attendance,
most of the States being represented by delegates or otherwise.
The Secretary of this Society was present as a delegate from
Pennsylvania appointed by the Governor and also as a member
of the Commission appointed to investigate methods of prison
administration. The meetings were both interesting and profitable,
and a summary of the proceedings prepared by the Secretary
will be appended to this Report. (See pages 93-102.)</p>


<p class="ph4">COUNTY PRISONS.</p>

<p>The Secretary has continued his inspection of the county
prisons with especial reference to improvements made and needed.
Several counties have employed their inmates in farming and
with uniformly great success. Details of this work will be given
in the special report of the Secretary. The effects of our agitation
for better conditions in the county prisons are apparent. It
will be recalled that one year ago some attempt was made to
grade the larger counties according to their efficiency. In nearly
all of them, the markings this year indicate some improvement
in efficiency. Our method has been used in the inspection of the
county prisons of North Carolina, the average grade being stated
to be 56 per cent. An inspector of the New York County jails
has informed us that he intended to use a similar plan in estimating
the efficiency of the county jails in the Empire State.</p>


<p class="ph4">DIETETICS.</p>

<p>There is much complaint from almost every penal institution
of the Commonwealth in regard to the character of the food and
the manner of its preparation and serving. Denunciation of the
food is a perennial charge and is common to all public institutions.
It is just dawning on the minds of prison boards and
officials that it is sound economy to keep the prisoners in health
and that nourishing and palatable food conduces to health. The
inmates have abundant time both to prepare the food and to serve
it in accordance with approved sanitary methods. When it has
been shown that such improvement can be made in the quality
and wholesomeness of the food without increasing the cost, our
prison officials have been willing to give some attention to the
matter. The need of a balanced ration to be determined by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
food specialist is beginning to be recognized. There is no
thought of providing a luxurious menu, or of adding materially
to the cost of provisions. Government is easier when the prisoners
are satisfied with the diet.</p>

<p>We commend to the serious attention of officials and managers
of all our public institutions, whether for the convict, the
blind, the insane, the destitute, the subject of the appointment
of an expert dietitian who shall supervise the selection and the
preparation of the food, believing the results will amply justify
the expense involved whether considered from the standpoint
of health or economy.</p>


<p class="ph4">THE GENERAL AGENT.</p>

<p>The General Agent, Fred. J. Pooley, has diligently maintained
his mission of mercy at the Central Station. The opportunities
for helpful service have been so numerous as to justify his attendance
both at the morning and afternoon sessions of the
Court of the committing magistrate. In a large number of cases
of suspicion or of a trivial character, the Agent has been instrumental
in securing the discharge of the prisoners or in placing
them at once under the care of the probation officer, thus properly
saving them from the evil associations of a term in prison.
The magistrates often place the accused person in the charge of
our Agent. A home and employment may be found for them,
and quite often they are sent to relatives either in this State or
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The full report of the Agent will be found in the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>.</p>


<p class="ph4">CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>We desire to thank the friends by whose generous contributions
our work of restoration and timely assistance has been
made possible. So many stranded ones have told us they had no
place whatever to go except to our sheltering care.</p>

<p>With the means entrusted to our use, our friends have
materially aided in the circulation of information and literature
throughout the Commonwealth, which, we have abundant reason
to believe, has been greatly instrumental in educating public sentiment
and therefore in ameliorating the conditions of our correctional
institutions.</p>

<p>For many reasons we are encouraged to continue in this
work of reformation in the hope that a sounder method of treating
offenders will result in lessening the incentives to commit
crime.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Acting Committee,</p>

<p>The General Agent has visited the cell-rooms of those
brought to the Central Station daily since November 19, 1910,
and since that time has sent 14,967 letters and notices to the
relatives and first friends of those who were arrested. Many
have thanked the Agent for this timely notice, thus giving the
relatives or friends the opportunity of securing the release of
those arrested, often on trivial charges, either by the payment
of a fine or release on bail or by direct discharge under the care
of parents or the probation officer. In some cases they have
been released under the care of the Agent.</p>

<p>The Agent is in daily attendance at the preliminary examination

<p>Emlen Hutchinson, Esq., has continued his generous donations

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_COUNTY_PRISONS">THE COUNTY PRISONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph4">BY A. H. VOTAW, SECRETARY.</p>


<p>The Secretary during the last year has paid some visits to
a few of the county prisons. The tendency is toward improvement
in the line of furnishing employment and in sanitary accommodations.</p>


<p class="ph4">ALLEGHENY COUNTY (CITY PRISON).</p>

<p>Conditions are much the same as last year. The management
is very ably conducted under Warden Lewis. The inmates
are largely those who are detained for trial. Out of 445 prisoners,
50 were convicts. Bread is made in the prison, an economical
feature whenever the population has an average of thirty or more.
Here meats are generally served in the shape of hamburg steaks.
We commend this practice to many of our wardens. The meat
is eatable, palatable and all the coarser parts may be utilized.
The cost of the food in 1916 was 8.4 cents daily for each prisoner,
one cent more than the previous year. Considering the
higher cost of all provisions, the additional cost is by no means
surprising. Too many were detained for non-payment of fines.
We trust they are now availing themselves of the law, passed
by the late Assembly, allowing those held for costs and fines
to be released on condition of agreeing to pay said charges by
instalments. Most letters received for those awaiting trial are
delivered unopened. Tho it would be a task to inspect all incoming
letters, it seems to us that it would be wiser to have a
universal rule providing for inspection of all letters.</p>


<p class="ph4">ALLEGHENY COUNTY (THE WORKHOUSE).</p>

<p>The apartments of the women have been greatly improved.
No women are now hired out. This may or may not be an improvement.
If they work out under proper influences and can
earn some wages, they may be improved thereby. Doubtless
there are difficulties encountered in making satisfactory arrangements
for their care. As there appears to be work for them at
the institution, the necessity for their finding work outside is
not apparent. The women now eat in a large dining-room at concrete
tables with surface of rubber composition rendering breakage
unusual and affording a surface which is readily cleansed.</p>

<p>The earnings last year of the farm and industries were
$111,290—the largest amount ever reported by the institution.
The overhead cost of each inmate is in gross 57 cents, but this is
reduced to 14 cents in consequence of the splendid earnings. The
time may come when this institution will become self-supporting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>


<p class="ph4">BERKS COUNTY.</p>

<p>We are delighted to report some improvements in the prison
at Reading. After strenuous effort by some members of the
Board, a few men have been allowed to work on the poor farm.
In 1917 they succeeded in raising several hundred bushels of
potatoes and were helpful in drainage projects. The experiment
is considered a success in every point of view. Next year under
the law providing for the employment of prisoners on county
land, which was approved July, 1917, more land may be cultivated
and more prisoners employed.</p>

<p>Striped suitings, which it was once thought was a custom
so firmly rooted as to be ineradicable at Reading, have been entirely
abrogated, a plain jeans suiting being substituted.</p>

<p>We learned that 22 men were on parole, an increase over
the report last year. These men were generally doing well.
Thirty-two men and boys had been placed on probation, serving
no part of their sentence in jail. They have a small yard in which
the men parade thrice weekly for a half hour each time. This
is insufficient. Measures should be taken at once to allow more
time in the open air under the blue sky.</p>

<p>The women prisoners should be entirely segregated from
the men’s quarters.</p>

<p>We now revise our estimate and make it approximately 70
per cent.</p>


<p class="ph4">BLAIR COUNTY.</p>

<p>The Secretary was hoping to have opportunity to revise his
estimate of the efficiency of the prison at Hollidaysburg, but was
informed that the Commissioners requested that he should have
an audience with them prior to making the usual examination.
The Commissioners were not in session at the time of his visit,
and so he did not insist upon his right as an Official Visitor. His
rule is to be subject to the local regulations. Last year the
Secretary was not favorably impressed with the sanitation and
some features of the management. He trusts that some improvements
have been made. He was pleased to learn that some men
were working on the county farm and others on the roads. He
did not learn whether the inmates were allowed to use the yard
for exercise or whether they had the privilege of remaining
outside of their cells longer than two hours a day. Letters ought
to be inspected when received.</p>

<p>The fee system is still in use, a practice generally more or
less abused. The Commissioners should very seriously consider
a proposition to appoint a warden who should purchase provisions
by contract. They buy bread. It would be more economical to
bake their own bread.</p>

<p>Parole has not yet been instituted in this county.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>On account of the road and farm work, we increase our
estimate of the efficiency from 41 per cent. to 48 per cent.</p>


<p class="ph4">CAMBRIA COUNTY.</p>

<p>Twenty-two men are reported to be working on roads. Several
men have been raising vegetables on land, part belonging to
the county and part rented for the purpose. A good beginning.
We think that next year Warden E. H. Knee will endeavor to
increase the amount of farm work.</p>

<p>Sixty-five prisoners are reported to be released on parole.</p>

<p>They ought to inspect incoming letters.</p>

<p>Those who enter a plea of guilty may be sentenced any month
in the year, and hence the number of those detained for trial is
greatly reduced.</p>

<p>They have long discontinued the fee system, the food by
contract costing the county daily for each prisoner 8.62 cents.
The workers eat at a table, and the warden wishes he had tables
for the entire population. They bake their own bread.</p>

<p>On account of the additional number doing good work for
the county we have raised our estimate from 59 per cent. to 65
per cent.</p>


<p class="ph4">CHESTER COUNTY.</p>

<p>We are pleased to report that new and satisfactory sanitary
appliances have been installed.</p>

<p>A sufficient amount of provisions is supplied and care is
taken in the preparation of the food. What is surprising, when
we take into consideration the greater cost of food, is that the
cost per diem for each prisoner in 1916 was 11 cents as against
12.3 cents the year before.</p>

<p>All the inmates are kept at work. The industries are carpet
weaving and chair-caning. They paid for materials $3,431 and
received $5,387.</p>

<p>The authorities are willing to allow some of the men to work
on farms but there is no county farm, or land belonging to the
county, which is available. Grade raised to 77 per cent.</p>


<p class="ph4">DAUPHIN COUNTY.</p>

<p>Here there are about 180 prisoners, say, 150 able-bodied persons,
detained in idleness, from a few days to a year with no
duties except in the line of domestic service. The bakery, the
kitchen, the serving and the work of sweeping and scrubbing
give nearly 25 per cent. of them some employment, and the good
warden by a system of rotation endeavors to give all their turn
at being useful. But what an appalling waste of labor!</p>

<p>There is no available land belonging to the county on which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
they might raise supplies for the institution. Dauphin County
needs a prison farm.</p>

<p>Formerly the warden received 25 cents per day for each
prisoner whom he maintained. Now the cost is 13.5 cents per
day and the menu is far superior to what was formerly dispensed
under the fee system. The meat ration is one-half pound
daily, which is regarded as too much for unemployed men. They
bake their own bread.</p>

<p>Strange to state, notwithstanding the lack of employment,
none are paroled. In this respect, the county is very much in
the rear of the procession.</p>

<p>As a rule, letters ought to be inspected before delivery.</p>

<p>Of the 168 hours in the week, the men may spend four hours
in the open air. Conditions are not as they should be and cannot
be improved materially till the question of employment is solved.</p>


<p class="ph4">DELAWARE COUNTY.</p>

<p>The county prison is fortunate in having a warden who does
not slumber on his job. If the laws of the State restrict employment
in some lines, this warden gets busy in some other lines.
It is vexatious to him to see able-bodied men dawdling about with
nothing to do. He gives them all the open air possible. On occasion
they may play games in their limited enclosure. Recently
he has constructed a special building in which the looms are installed.
No longer do they work in their cells, where they were
obliged to live, eat and sleep in lint-laden air. The men assist
in making improvements, and somehow there is something doing
in the line of repairs or improvements every minute.</p>

<p>At the personal request of the warden, the Court had liberated
some selected men to work on the poor farm, and the result
had been exceedingly satisfactory. They raised much of the vegetables
for their own use, and what they could not eat at the time
they canned for future use. They bake their own bread.</p>

<p>The Court here was one of the first to adopt the principle
of parole, and in no county of the Commonwealth have so many
offenders been placed on parole and probation and with such good
results. Grade increased from 67 to 75 per cent.</p>


<p class="ph4">FAYETTE COUNTY.</p>

<p>Average number of prisoners every day in 1916 was 130, of
whom they manage to employ 30 per cent. and would be glad to
have all at work. Some 25 men have been at work on roads and
farms at a wage of 25 cents per day. The road-making has been
very profitable to the county. The general results have been
altogether satisfactory.</p>

<p>They buy their bread, but we think they could employ some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
of their idle men in making and baking bread and also save
money by the operation.</p>

<p>Cost of food 15 cents each prisoner daily, four cents more
than the year before. They now serve three meals daily instead
of two.</p>

<p>They need sheets and pillow cases. They have abundant help
for a laundry.</p>

<p>Unless the men are at work, they are never in the open air,
but they have the freedom of the corridors during the daytime.</p>


<p class="ph4">LACKAWANNA COUNTY.</p>

<p>No special changes since 1916 to report, except that the
number of prisoners has decreased about 50 per cent. This may
indicate for that county a higher average of morals.</p>

<p>Last summer they were buying a pound loaf of good bread
for 5 cents, and while flour is $14.00 the barrel they were not
disposed to construct a bake shop.</p>

<p>While they were willing to employ convicts on land belonging
to the county, they thought it would be difficult to find among
their convicts, many of them serving quite short sentences, enough
reliable men to constitute a workable gang.</p>

<p>Food is purchased by contract, and the county allows the
prison authorities to expend as much as 20 cents daily for each
inmate.</p>

<p>Whoever has power to order repairs ought to get busy. We
understand the grand jury usually calls attention to the urgent
need of improvements, but their suggestions are unheeded. It is
poor economy to allow these unwholesome conditions to continue.</p>


<p class="ph4">LEHIGH COUNTY.</p>

<p>Farmers are encouraged in this county, as labor is scarce,
to apply to the parole officer for the privilege of employing some
prisoners who can be recommended. Thus, some twenty-five men
have been released to work on farms. The results appear to be
satisfactory. The men receive wages and the county is not
charged with supporting them in comparative idleness. Some
of the men are employed in carpet weaving and rug-making, the
profit on which in 1916 was $1,500.</p>

<p>When the law providing for the release of prisoners held
for fines on condition of paying the charges by instalments was
approved, the Court and parole officers immediately put the law
to practical use. Within eight weeks the sum of $2,600 was
collected on this account—an amount more than saved, since
otherwise the men would have been maintained at the expense of
the county and not one cent would have been received.</p>

<p>We trust that by this time the new entrance planned for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
access to the apartments of the women prisoners has been constructed.
Heretofore the women have been obliged to file through
a corridor occupied by the men, a custom salutary for neither
men nor women.</p>

<p>The work of probation, parole, non-support, truancy and
collection of fines under the recent law is all administered from
one central office by a general officer with assistants. On the
ground of economy and practical results, we commend this policy
to other counties.</p>

<p>Percentage of efficiency raised from 60 per cent. to 70 per
cent.</p>


<p class="ph4">LUZERNE COUNTY.</p>

<p>As is frequently the custom of county prisons, this prison
contains both prisoners committed by the county court and also
the city misdemeanants. The city prisoners have been allowed
to work outside on the county farm. The authorities have not
been willing to assume the responsibility for paroling the county
prisoners for outside work. It is quite possible that in the spring
of 1918 they may take action under the special legislation of
the late Assembly.</p>

<p>There are some acres of ground about the institution which
is kept in an admirable order by the inmates, but no space has
been set aside or adapted for an exercise ground for the
prisoners. This is a matter which should receive attention. The
open air is wholesome, and men should not be deprived of this
privilege even if they are felons.</p>

<p>This institution was one of the last to adhere to a striped
costume, which has finally been superseded by suitings of plain
colors.</p>

<p>They ought to add a bakery to their cooking department.
We believe this prison would profit by the employment of a professional
cook.</p>

<p>The warden manages to find employment for nearly all of
the prisoners in some sort of domestic service, tho no special
industries are maintained.</p>

<p>A liberal application of the privilege of parole is noticeable
in this county. The results are very satisfactory.</p>

<p>General efficiency the same as the year before.</p>


<p class="ph4">MONTGOMERY COUNTY.</p>

<p>Early in the season of 1917 some men were paroled to work
on the county farm. The satisfactory results are reported in our
account of the Wardens’ Meeting. The authorities have been so
well pleased with this experiment that it is probable next season
will witness some enlargement of these activities. Some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
men have been employed in finishing rugs, but this industry last
summer was lagging.</p>

<p>They bake an excellent quality of bread, and prepare a menu
somewhat above the average. Their experiment with cocoa nibs
was not satisfactory; the men greatly prefer coffee. At some
institutions, cocoa is being served occasionally as a substitute
for coffee, and the inmates appear to enjoy it. A drink made
from cheap cocoa nibs may not have much nutriment, but real
cocoa possesses considerable nutriment, while coffee has no value
as food, but may act as a stimulant.</p>

<p>Estimated efficiency now rated at 75 per cent.</p>


<p class="ph4">NORTHAMPTON COUNTY.</p>

<p>Here they are considering a proposition to place a gang of
laborers on a county farm. The warden is favorable to the
experiment and will do all he can to make the effort a success.</p>

<p>So far as we know to date, they are not discharging prisoners,
detained on account of fines, on condition of paying costs
or fines in instalments. Next year we hope to hear they have
established this system which in some other counties has proved
to be eminently satisfactory.</p>

<p>The prisoners listlessly parade for an hour and a half each
day either in the corridors or in the small exercise yard. They
spend the remainder of the time in their cells excepting those who
weave carpet or engage in domestic duties.</p>

<p>In 1916 the average daily cost of the food per prisoner was
17.8 cents, and there was an attempt to serve some variety. They
purchase bread.</p>

<p>None were reported on the parole list. What is the matter
with this county? Are there no prisoners fit for parole? Or
is the Court still unconvinced? Will Northampton County be the
last to adopt a system, the principle of which is becoming universally
recognized?</p>

<p>No change this year in Efficiency grading.</p>


<p class="ph4">PHILADELPHIA COUNTY.</p>

<p>The two departments of this prison, one the convict prison
at Holmesburg, the other the receiving prison at Moyamensing,
pursue the even tenor of their way. There is little change to
report. The sanitary appliances have had much attention within
the last few years, and are now in practically perfect condition.
The latest cell blocks at the Holmesburg prison represent the best
thought in most ways of prison construction. The cells seem
like rooms, not cages, the windows deserve the name, and the
sanitation is correct. At this prison the solitary system may still
be studied. Those who work, however, and there is a goodly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
proportion, eat at tables and converse freely at all times while
employed. There is still no special work other than domestic
service and work of repairs and extensions.</p>

<p>The hospital at both departments is well equipped.</p>

<p>For years prisoners have not suffered much detention on account
of non-payment of fines. Fines have been imposed but
within the last five years less than 10 per cent. of the amount
has been collected. We have no report of the operation of the
new law by which fines may be paid in instalments.</p>

<p>Grand juries may come and grand juries may go, but the
institution pursues its unwavering course. Sometimes the jury
recommends improvements which the management desires as
sincerely as the jury. Many of these improvements have been
made, and it may be the published reports of the grand jury may
have rendered the task of securing appropriations a little more
easy. But it is an impossible task for any body of twelve or
fifteen men within the time of two or three hours to study the
conditions of an institution so as to present a well-developed
scheme for its management.</p>

<p>We hold no brief for the Philadelphia County Prison. Doubtless
some conditions could be improved. But the jury occasionally
in its zeal magnifies a possible wrong or views some punitive
feature out of its proper prospective. The discipline for a
body of untried prisoners, some of whom may prove to be dangerous
criminals, must not be squared by the discipline meted out
to convicts who remain year after year in the same institution.
You deal with one set as with people you know, the others present
unknown dangerous proclivities. The tendency is to treat a body
of transients with a stricter set of regulations. Just how far
the principles of “The New Penology” have entered the precincts
of Philadelphia County Prison, we are not prepared to
discuss. There is a medium ground in all things and in prison
management, probably the safest plan is to take the middle course.
Compared with the “Tombs,” the New York County prison for
those detained for trial, the prison at Moyamensing compares
very favorably. The advantages, the employments, the general
discipline of the New York Convict prisons at Blackwell’s and
Riker’s Islands are perhaps in the main superior to our convict
prison. The regulations for those held for trial should be
as mild and reasonable as is consistent with safety and the convenience
of the accused person. While they are not yet convicts,
many of them are well-known recidivists, more or less dangerous,
some are entirely unknown and need watchful care, so that
any system founded on uniform treatment for all is liable to
criticism. A system which combines moderate restraint with
exactly the right proportion of reasonable freedom presents a
problem which a novice can no more readily solve than an ignoramus
the elements of an eclipse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Down at Moyamensing they have the buildings and the
space for the detention of the untried prisoners, and we have little
doubt but that the manager and the court officials, if they were
to meet for a conference, could unite in the adoption of regulations
which would be satisfactory to all parties concerned. It
is to the city’s direct interest to make use of the facilities already
possessed. We are inclined to the belief that the construction
of a new prison for the untried may be an economic blunder.</p>


<p class="ph4">SCHUYLKILL COUNTY.</p>

<p>We learn that ten men have been working on the county
farm.</p>

<p>This county for some years has been allowing men who were
fined to be released on condition of making payments on instalments.
In 1916 they collected from this source the sum of
$2,081.14. If these men and women had been maintained in prison
in accordance with the old law of 1836, their board and maintenance
would have cost the taxpayers $4,025.38. Hence by the
new arrangement a snug profit to the county of $6,106.52. They
were pioneers in the rational treatment of those who were fined.</p>

<p>Here they believe in the principle of parole and put it into
practice.</p>

<p>Some failures reported, the majority being juveniles arrested
for truancy, etc.</p>

<p>They still continue their antiquated toilet arrangements. The
closets are flushed by dumping therein water from buckets. The
water is readily obtainable from spigots, so that the inconvenience
is reduced to some extent, yet this system is justly condemned.</p>

<p>Trusties keep the Court House and the grounds in good
order. Some are employed in making carpets and knitting socks.</p>

<p>Except murderers in the second degree, practically all county
convicts are detained in the county prison. They have room
for them in the old bastile, so why send them to the penitentiary
on per diem charges?</p>

<p>The prisoners are turned absolutely loose one hour each day
in the prison yard.</p>

<p>General Efficiency the same as the previous year, but on
account of the farm work we estimate the grade at 70 per cent.</p>


<p class="ph4">WESTMORELAND COUNTY.</p>

<p>Here is a county prison reporting for the year 1916 an average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
daily number of inmates of 58. And yet they could send
12 men to work at road-making in a prison camp, and 10
men to work on the county farm. The employment record
is a vast improvement over the report of the previous year when
a few at domestic employments about the jail were the only inmates
at work. It is thought that next season the agricultural
operations will be increased.</p>

<p>The Directors ought to contrive at once to improve the
cooking arrangements or, better still, to construct an entirely new
culinary department.</p>

<p>They eat at tables in the corridors. We believe that it would
be well for wardens generally to adopt this method. The cells
are more readily kept clean, and the appearance has a civilized
effect.</p>

<p>There are no sheets and pillows, a lack which some philanthropic
organization might supply. They have plenty of time to
do laundry work.</p>

<p>On account of the new opportunities for employment, we
cheerfully revise our estimate of the Efficiency from 53 to 65
per cent.</p>


<p class="ph4">YORK COUNTY.</p>

<p>No official visit has been paid to the prison at York since the
last report. We have learned that conditions are generally unchanged.
If this be true, there is much ground for complaint.</p>

<p>There is no employment except that a few assist in domestic
service at the prison.</p>

<p>The food supplied is utterly inadequate. A few weeks ago
the bill of fare for one week consisted of bread and coffee served
twice a day for the seven days and a ration of soup with meat
and vegetables was served twice during the week. On one other
day three potatoes were dealt out to each prisoner. A certain
amount of molasses is given out each week. No prison in the
United States or Canada has such scanty fare. The prisoners
are allowed to supplement their fare by purchasing supplies from
a dealer who calls almost every morning, but the majority of
them are penniless. Their friends, if they have any, may bring
provision.</p>

<p>The sheriff receives forty-five cents a day for providing this
meagre fare. Again and again we have called the attention
of the good people of York County to these disgraceful conditions.
One hundred and thirty years ago in the prisons of
Philadelphia, each prisoner was furnished with water and a half
loaf of bread every day. Those who had money could buy additional
supplies; others must beg and depend upon friends. The
York Prison has maintained a similar system to the present day.
There has been no progress. The sheriff follows in the line of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
his predecessors. The authorities, under whom this iniquitous
system has been allowed to continue, are the responsible parties.
If the fare at other prisons, where a sufficient quantity is served,
costs from 12 cents to 16 cents per day, the fare at York County
prison costs barely 10 cents per day. Possibly the sheriff finds
the business profitable, but that has little to do with the matter.
The system is wrong. Any plan whereby the superintendent of
any prison derives his profit from boarding the inmates is liable
to abuse. The only remedy is to change the system. Act 171,
Laws of Pennsylvania 1909, provides that all counties having
a population between 150,000 and 250,000 must have a warden
who purchases supplies by contract. Such a warden may be appointed
in counties having less than a population of 150,000. The
remedy lies with the citizens of York County. A number of
prisons in counties having less than a population of 150,000 are
controlled by either a warden or sheriff who serves for a salary
and purchases food by contract. In such prisons, the conditions
are always better than under the fee system. Grade 40 per cent.</p>

<hr class="tiny">

<p>Later. As we are going to press, we learn that proceedings
are being brought before the court in York County with a view
of making some wholesome changes. This Society endorses the
efforts of the good citizens of York to remove an evil which
has too long been a reproach to that community.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WARDENS_MEETING_AT_GLEN_MILLS_AND">THE WARDENS’ MEETING AT GLEN MILLS AND
SLEIGHTON FARM, OCTOBER 4-5, 1917.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Reported by Florence Bayard Kane.</span></p>


<p>In view of the fact that some important penal legislation was
enacted by the General Assembly of 1917, it seemed wise to call
a conference of wardens, inspectors and commissioners to consider
the effect of this legislation and how it might be put into
practice.</p>

<p>Hence a call for such a conference, issued by The Pennsylvania
Prison Society and by the Prison Reform League of Pennsylvania,
was sent to county commissioners and prison officials in
the eastern and central parts of the Commonwealth. Mrs. Martha
P. Falconer, superintendent of the Girls’ School at Sleighton
Farm, very kindly offered to entertain the members of the Conference
at this institution on the afternoon and night of October
4th, and Mr. F. H. Nibecker, superintendent of the Boys’ Department
at Glen Mills, cordially agreed to take care of the company
on the 5th inst.</p>

<p>Responses from those invited indicated much interest, and
the attendance fully justified our expectations.</p>

<p>Nine wardens were present from the county prisons of
Easton, Ebensburg, Harrisburg, Hollidaysburg, Lancaster, Media,
Norristown, West Chester and Wilkes-Barre. Seventeen Inspectors
were in attendance representing the counties of Berks,
Blair, Chester, Dauphin, Delaware, Lehigh, Lancaster and Montgomery.
The counties of Bucks, Chester, Columbia and York
were represented by one or more of their Commissioners.</p>

<p>The State Board of Charities was represented by Mr. Louis
Wolf, a member of that body, and by Wm. McGarry, an agent
of the Board.</p>

<p>Judge J. F. Hause, of West Chester, graced the occasion with
his presence.</p>

<p>Miss Florence Bayard Kane, of the Prison Reform League,
and John Way and Albert H. Votaw, of the Pennsylvania Prison
Society, were present. Robert Dunning Dripps, Esq., Secretary
Public Charities Association, was present on the evening of the
4th inst.</p>

<p>Most of the company arrived about noon at Sleighton Farm
and were soon doing ample justice to a bountiful lunch provided
by the efficient helpers of Mrs. Falconer. After an inspection of
the buildings and grounds and noting the excellent work of the
girls on the Farm and the fifty-acre kitchen garden the company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
assembled in the commodious audience room to consider the
objects of the meeting.</p>

<p>Secretary Votaw called the meeting to order and served
thereafter informally as Chairman. He said he was convinced
that persons engaged in the same sort of work often were the
gainers by comparing their views and experiences. As a teacher
he had learned to value the opportunities afforded by the Teachers’
Institutes. Not that he always adopted new methods proposed,
for he learned that the personal equation must be considered and
that all persons were not adapted to use identical methods. What
would succeed with one might result in failure with another. At
the same time, there was inspiration and much profit from such
conferences. He ventured to say that the county prisons in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were all diverse in their administration.
There was lack of team work. While it was not recommended
that all should follow exactly the same form of management,
there was undoubtedly much to be gained by comparison
of methods and results.</p>

<p>This meeting, however, was called particularly to consider
recent legislation. The following letter from Governor Brumbaugh,
addressed to E. M. Wistar, President of the Pennsylvania
Prison Society, was read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Mr. Edward M. Wistar</span>,<br>
Philadelphia, Pa.<br>
<br>
<i>My Dear Mr. Wistar</i>:<br>
</p>

<p>I have the letter of Mr. Votaw, calling my attention to a
meeting to be held at Darlington, Pa., October 4th and 5th.</p>

<p>The purpose of the meeting, as I understand it, is to ascertain
in what way recent legislation affecting prison labor may be
most practically and effectively applied to conditions in this Commonwealth.
I am heartily in favor of the wise employment of the
prisoners in our penal institutions, and steadfastly favored and
approved all legislation having that end in view.</p>

<p>I consider, therefore, this conference most opportune, and
trust that its deliberations may result in practical guidance of
great moment to Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to you to know that we are now planning
to utilize such of our prison labor as we can in connection
with the Highway Department, not only because we believe this
is right as a fundamental principle, but because in this emergency
it will release other labor for national service without impairing
the road construction program of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>I wish your convention great success, and beg to be</p>

<p class="author2">
Very truly yours,</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>The wardens were first asked to relate their experience with
regard to the recent law allowing the wardens or superintendents
of prisons to release the inmates for work on land belonging to
the county or state.</p>

<p>Warden George W. Allen, of Media, being called upon, told
the Conference that he had been employing from seven to fourteen
men on the county farm since early in the spring, even before
the Act had received executive sanction. At his request Judge
Isaac Johnson had, as privileged under the law granting parole
to county prisoners, paroled certain selected inmates for this purpose.
None of the prisoners had violated their parole nor attempted
to escape. They were taken in a van every morning to
their work with one guard, and had worked faithfully and with
pleasure. They had cultivated about 20 acres of land. The
entire cost of the venture was about $1100.00, a sum which the
results had fully justified. The expense had been equally shared
with the Poor Directors and also the proceeds. They had raised
cabbage, soup beans, lima beans, carrots, turnips, potatoes, beets,
tomatoes and other produce. What was not used at once by the
prisoners was dried, canned or stored for winter use. No wages
was paid to the men. The result had been satisfactory to all
parties concerned.</p>

<p>Dr. J. K. Weaver, Prison Inspector, of Norristown, informed
the assembly that nineteen men had been sent to the Poor Farm,
whose officials had taken charge of them and had provided them
with food and lodging. There had been no difficulty whatever
in maintaining discipline. The men had worked well and with
enjoyment. A few privileges were allowed, such as swimming
in the river when the day’s work was done, and no one had attempted
to escape. They were paid 60c. a day for their work,
payable at the time of their release. One man earned $52.80.</p>

<p>Warden Lemuel Roberts, of the Norristown Prison, informed
the meeting that this employment of prisoners in Montgomery
County had been initiated by presenting a petition to the Court
to parole a few selected men to work on this Farm. The Court
consented to parole three men for this purpose, and the experiment
was so completely successful that the number thus paroled
was gradually increased to nineteen. He was convinced that the
payment of 60c. per day had served a double purpose in giving
the men an incentive and a reward for good conduct and also in
enabling them to go forth with a little cash to pay their expenses
while searching for further employment. Without money and
without friends, very often released convicts resort to crime for
their maintenance.</p>

<p>Warden John F. Clower, of West Chester, stated that the
County Home had refused to employ prisoners for the reason
that they had already an abundant supply of labor from their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
inmates. They had bought from the Farm supplies of vegetables
at a lower rate than in the open market. For winter use they
had canned 400 jars of tomatoes and a large quantity of sauerkraut.</p>

<p>Five of the inmates had been paroled to neighboring farmers,
for whose labor the prison had received $25.00 per month, the
prisoner receiving no large share. In this prison the men are
almost all employed constantly at work in making carpets, caning
chairs and weaving cloth for their clothing. In 1917 they had
sold products amounting to $5,387. A small allowance, about
19c. weekly, is paid to the prisoners.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas J. Fretz, an Inspector of Lehigh County, stated
that a number of prisoners had been paroled directly to farmers.
It was stipulated that the men should receive the prevailing customary
wage for this work and that this sum should be paid to
the families of the paroled men, or given to them on their discharge.
In some instances wages sufficient to pay certain costs
had been deducted from the amount paid to the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Taenzer, Inspector of Berks County, informed
the meeting that this season they had employed prisoners on their
County Farm, and that the experiment had been a decided success
from every point of view. Two years ago an effort had been
made to employ the prisoners on this land, and this proposition
had been heartily approved by the Inspectors, the County Commissioners,
the Directors of the Poor and the local press. The
Solicitors of the Boards, however, held that such action was
illegal, admitting that work on roads was the only employment
allowed to prisoners except behind the bars. Since the beginning
of the great war Mr. Taenzer and others renewed their efforts
to find employment for the prisoners on farms, meeting with
formidable opposition, but since the legal bar was removed by
recent legislation the prisoners have been hard at work, giving
satisfaction to all concerned. The selected men are taken by
conveyance to the Farm and work for eight hours daily. They
have produced from four to five hundred bushels of potatoes and
a like proportion of other vegetables. Just now they are working
on the drainage project. The Poor Directors provide the midday
meal, and it is expected that hereafter they may provide for the
necessary supervision. The men receive no pay for their labor,
but esteem it a great privilege thus to be employed.</p>

<p>Secretary Votaw stated that the consensus of opinion was
evidently favorable to the employment of county prisoners on
farms as far as possible. He invited Agent McGarry, of the
State Board of Charities, to comment on the attitude of this Board
on this subject. Mr. McGarry said that the Board had for many
years advocated such employment and that the emergency created
by the war had made such legislation possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The Acting Chairman then called the attention of the conference
to Act. No. 399, which received the approval of the Governor
on the 20th of July, 1917. The law had practically been
unheralded, but its execution would revolutionize conditions in all
the counties of the State. The Act provides for the division of
the State into nine Districts, containing from five to ten counties,
in each of which Districts there shall be established an institution
to which all convicts, sentenced to a term of ten days or more, may
be sent. It seemed to be formulated with a view to the general
betterment of the prisoners confined in the county jails. The fact
that there was no clause making it compulsory to send prisoners
to such institution was regarded as a weak feature.</p>

<p>General discussion followed. There were many present who
had not seen the law, or even heard thereof. There was a general
opinion that this law should be carefully considered before the
conference should come to a settled conclusion.</p>

<p>Secretary Votaw hoped that at least one of the nine Districts
would give the experiment a fair trial. It was evident that existing
conditions in the county jails would have to be changed, and
the officials ought to be warned that some action must be taken.
Was there any better proposition to be considered? Since the
Allegheny penal farm already contained five or six hundred
acres, and since most of the adjoining counties were already sending
many of their prisoners there, paying at rate of 50c. daily per
prisoner, he suggested that the District in which this workhouse
was situated might readily convert this institution into one of
these Industrial Farms. While at this institution to which convicts
from Pittsburgh are sent, it seems possible to put ten-day,
and even five-day, prisoners to some profitable work, it would be
poor economy to transport ten-day prisoners from the more distant
counties to said District Farm.</p>

<p>Mr. McGarry raised a question as to the disposal of existing
jail properties.</p>

<p>Secretary Votaw said that they would be still needed for
short termers and persons awaiting trial, but that portions of
such jail property might be profitably disposed of. Very often
the county jail stood on rather valuable real estate which might
sometimes be sold for sufficient to meet the county’s quota on the
new District Institution. To illustrate that existing prisons must
still be used as places of detention, it was shown during the meetings
that at the recent visits of Secretary Votaw in his capacity
of Official Visitor, one third of the inmates in thirteen of the
larger counties were being detained for trial. It is to be hoped
that the problem of furnishing employment to the untried prisoners
may be found.</p>

<p>Mr. Louis Wolf was inclined on first reading of the bill to
think that it would prove impracticable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>It was explained that this Act might have imperfections, but
that it was really the only solution of the problem of employment
for prisoners as far as conditions existed in this Commonwealth.
If the products of convict labor are not allowed to be sold in the
market some other way must be devised to set these idle people
to work. In these times of dire stress, not an ounce of energy
should be lost. Our Government needs the labor of every man,
good or bad, in order to increase the production of food supplies,
and for manufacturing purposes. Wherever the farming
proposition for prisoners had been fairly tried there was no indication
of receding. Reports from most places where prisoners
were employed in agricultural pursuits were enthusiastic. In
the State of Massachusetts misdemeanants are generally sent to
Bridgwater Industrial Farm where, under efficient management,
several hundred acres of land, thought to be almost worthless,
have been reclaimed, and now are returning a large yield of
fruits, vegetables and grain crops. In the State of Indiana within
the last three years a farm of about 1200 acres has been purchased
by the State, to which now all misdemeanants sentenced to
a term of sixty days or more in the county prisons are to be sent.
It is at the option of the Court whether those sentenced for shorter
terms shall be sentenced to this farm prison. Eventually it is
thought this farm will be entirely self-supporting. There were
many escapes the first year, but since a law has been enacted
making it a penal offence to escape or to endeavor to escape the
number of fugitives has greatly decreased. The proposition is not
new and is being tried out with greater or less success.</p>

<p>Inspector W. B. Meetch, of Dauphin County, said that the
prison at Harrisburg just now had a population of 207, of whom
53 were sentenced to a term of sixty days or more. These men
might be available for farm work, but the Court is averse to the
principle of parole. However, he was inclined to believe that the
privileges of free men should be denied to the wrongdoer in order
that there might be some contrast between the condition of the
law-breaker and the man who was observant of the rules of
justice. He would exercise great caution in reference to presenting
them with the opportunities to escape. Men were sent
to prison to be punished.</p>

<p>It was pointed out that the modern idea did not wholly discard
the element of punishment in the treatment of criminals, but,
for the benefit both of society and the individual, placed extreme
emphasis on efforts to reform the wrongdoer and furnish him
with incentives to become a useful member of the community
instead of a perpetual menace. There is the publicity of a trial,
the confinement to certain limits whether behind walls or within
other definite limits, the restraint of a discipline to which a free
man is not subject. This is regarded as sufficient punishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
in these days. We have discarded the stocks, the pillory, cropped
hair and the striped suit. The disgrace is sufficient without these
barbaric accompaniments. In the effort to treat the criminal as
a human being very much like the rest of us, since we all acknowledge
that we have sinned, modern methods have found the best
remedy for the restoration of the prisoner. If we treat him as
an outcast, he will remain an outcast who will harry the community
to the end of his days. Above all, cease to detain him in
idleness, which is the worst remedy for immorality of any sort.</p>

<p>Warden Wm. A. McIlhenny, of Harrisburg, stated that
there was no land owned by Dauphin County which was
available for the employment of his prisoners. The county farm
was limited in size and was cared for by the regular inmates of
the County Poorhouse. He had no doubt that if the law allowed
prisoners to work on other than county land, some kindly disposed
land owners would freely grant land for such purpose.</p>


<p class="ph4">THE WORK ON SLEIGHTON FARM.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer was called upon to explain the methods on
Sleighton Farm. She made an earnest plea that women or girls
who are prisoners be allowed to work in the open air. Although
all the inmates of the institution have a thorough course in housekeeping
and sewing, she was sure that these are not invariably the
best occupations for women. She stated that there was no room
for question that country life and sounds and smells and diverse
occupations were the most helpful for such weak sisters as fall
by the wayside. No other work is so suitable to children or
adapted so well to their powers as work out in the open. She
had felt it essential to have a woman of ability and character to
have general management of the farm work, inasmuch as many
of those committed to her care were, in a sense, oversexed and
they needed to be associated constantly with good women. This
was a rule in the selection of all her assistants. As far as possible,
men are eliminated from the activities on the farm, so that
these girls come entirely under the wholesome influence of young
women specially trained for the various kinds of employment on
the farm. The enthusiasm and enjoyment connected with the
varied occupations on the farm have strong psychological value.</p>

<p>As “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,” so the
same method would have the same effect on “Jill.” Hence, a
reasonable amount of amusement is encouraged. Whatever gift
any girl may have, in the line of song or music or recitation, is
developed. They have various entertainments in their assembly
room.</p>

<p>In consequence of the present stringency and high prices,
she had been obliged to change the menu, and the results have
been carefully observed. For instance, meat has been almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
entirely dropped from the bill of fare, and so far there has been
no indication that the health of her community had suffered.
There is no tea or coffee for any one on the place, nor stimulant
of any sort. They have abundance of milk, cottage-cheese, cocoa,
cereals and all the dry and green vegetables they can eat. The
ration has been scientifically studied so that the physical requirements
may be satisfied. This report was exceedingly interesting
to the wardens present, all of whom have been confronted with
the serious nature of the food problem.</p>

<p>This summer a few of the girls in groups of four or five
have been paroled to work on some neighboring farms. They
receive twenty cents an hour for their labor and are allowed to
retain their wages. In some instances they have gone without
supervision. The results have been very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Miss Farrall, Head Farmer, spoke of the pleasure of the
children in propagating the plants in the hot house, in setting
out the plants, in watching their growth and in all the varied
agricultural processes. Besides the actual work on the farm the
girls had been employed in road-building, even the concrete work
being done by them. They have installed a new drainage system.
They are trained in the care of hogs and poultry, and on the
newly acquired farm adjacent to their premises they hope soon
to develop some dairy industry. The children have done nearly
all the work on a fifty-acre garden. They have already gathered
1100 bushels of potatoes, and the harvesting of the crop is not
complete. They have planted, cultivated and husked seventeen
acres of corn. They are raising turnips, parsnips, salsify, beets,
carrots, and have succeeded, in spite of the worms, in harvesting
1000 heads of cabbage. They had used their green house this
season in drying large quantities of vegetables for winter use.</p>


<p class="ph4">THE INTERMISSION.</p>

<p>In the intermission between the afternoon and evening sessions
there were three events of considerable interest.</p>

<ol>
<li>A baseball game, in which a nine from the visitors contested
with a nine of the school. No game of the year anywhere
elicited more enthusiasm. The score was 15 to 12 in favor of
the home nine. In the last inning the visitors, who had been
somewhat ahead, went “all to pieces,” and the 500 girls retired
from the bleaching grounds to their quarters exultant over the
famous victory of the nine of Sleighton Farm.</li>

<li>A delicious supper served by the girls of the farm.</li>

<li>A charming vocal concert given by the girls in the Assembly
Room, under the direction of Mrs. Falconer.</li>
</ol>

<p>At 8.30 in the evening the conference assembled in the reception
room of the Administration Building. Consideration of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the bill providing for the establishment of nine industrial farms
was resumed.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Dunning Dripps spoke of the admirable purpose
of the bill, though admitting that certain modifications were probably
needed to render it thoroughly effective. He was emphatic
in condemnation of the conditions now existent in the county
jails. The employment of all prisoners must be guaranteed. So
far as possible they should be employed in the open air, in order
to build up their physical condition. Such work, under wise
handling, has solved some of the economic problems of prison
management. We have too many jails. Fewer prisons with
equal conditions of population and opportunities could be administered
more effectively and economically. Farm penal institutions
in many places have gone beyond the experimental stage
and have revealed amazing possibilities of reformation, economy
and ease of administration. Witness our State Farm at Bellefonte,
various penal farms in New York, the misdemeanant
farms in Massachusetts and Indiana, and the large penal farm at
Guelph, Ontario. Farm work could be managed by the inmates
of county jails with less risk on the whole than by the convicts
sent to the penitentiaries. If a few escape the harm they would
do to any community would be less on the average than hardened
convicts who receive the long sentences. He recalled that all
properly managed insane asylums have their inmates in the open
air as much as possible and give them every opportunity to engage
in the work of raising the supplies of food. It is all wrong to
pen up a thousand men in close confinement because some half
dozen of them may try to escape. He did not speak as a mere
theorist, because, as Director of Public Safety, he had been
responsible for the management of the House of Correction,
where he had observed the beneficial effects of working on the
farm and the ease with which this sort of work could be administered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer emphasized the viciousness of idleness. She
knew of the wholesome results of allowing women to work in the
open, and, of course, it must readily follow that men would be
equally improved.</p>

<p>Mr. Pascoe, Warden of the prison at Easton, stated that he
had about 100 prisoners who are only partially employed in
carpet weaving. He has a small exercise yard where his men
are allowed to parade about an hour daily. With his scant space
and opportunities he is hampered. He would be very willing
to make arrangements to have his men work on the Poor Farm
about seven miles away if the authorities would grant the privilege.
He is entirely aware of the evils of idleness, and would
welcome the opportunity to employ his inmates in farm work.
Possibly a few might escape, but the harm they might do would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
be entirely out of proportion to the injury done to the men by the
present system of detaining them in idleness.</p>


<p class="ph4">THE GLEN MILLS FARM.</p>

<p>It was the first visit of most of the men to this highly cultivated
farm of 500 or more acres, and they were both surprised
and delighted to have a visible illustration of what may be accomplished
by lads and young men in the line of husbandry.
They were received very graciously by Superintendent Nibecker,
who, after some explanation of the general system, conducted
them over the plantation. There was an exhibit of corn (many
stalks being fifteen feet in height, with two ears), pumpkins, cowbeets,
turnips, etc., which would make a creditable showing before
any body of experts. The dairy of blooded stock was inspected,
and a piggery inhabited by over 200 fine specimens of porkers
was much admired for its fine sanitary condition. The report in
1916 showed that about forty products of the farm were valued
at $23,581 and that the expenses charged to the farm amounted
to $8,033, thus showing the handsome balance of $15,548 to the
credit of the farming operations.</p>

<p>The Conference met for a brief session in the parlor of the
institution. On motion, Mr. Edward Taenzer, of Reading, was
made Chairman of this meeting. Mr. Votaw had already suggested
that there might be a service in forming a more permanent
organization of prison officials of this Commonwealth.
There were many features of administration to be discussed, and
he thought mutual benefit would accrue from an occasional conference,
annual or semi-annual, to compare views and methods.
Especially would such conference be of value and of great influence
in being able to present to the General Assembly their
united views, based on practical experience, with regard to proposed
penal legislation, and also to suggest and promote measures
for improvement of penal conditions. This proposition appeared
to receive the unanimous endorsement of those present.</p>

<p>Chairman Taenzer suggested annual conferences and hoped
that an effort would be made to equalize the working of the laws
in all counties. Many of the counties operated under special
legislation. The County of Berks, working under an Act of 1848,
was at a decided disadvantage, compared with other counties.
There was no uniformity in regard to turnkey fees, and many
other customs, some of them belonging to a past age.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Votaw the following Committee was
appointed to make arrangements for another similar conference
to be held probably next autumn, and to draft regulations for the
government of the body: Edward Taenzer, Chairman; Warden
Clower, of West Chester; Warden McIlhenny, of Harrisburg;
Warden Obetz, of Lancaster, and Agent McGarry, of the State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Board of Charities. On motion, A. H. Votaw was appointed
Secretary of this Committee.</p>

<p>A vote of thanks to Mrs. Falconer and to Mr. Nibecker was
extended for their generous hospitality and for their many courtesies
to the conference. It seemed that nothing which pertained
to the comfort and pleasure of the visitors had been left undone.</p>

<p>The Conference adjourned with a feeling that this meeting
had been successful and that a permanent organization would be
of decided service to the best interests of the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>After a bountiful lunch, served by the assistants of Superintendent
Nibecker, the members of this memorable Conference
dispersed to their several homes.</p>

<p>The late John J. Lytle, than whom no one was more deeply
interested in the welfare of prisoners, year after year by special
effort solicited contributions for the purchase of periodical literature
suitable for distribution to the inmates of our prisons. A
journal known as “Sabbath Reading,” issued weekly, was selected,
a periodical judiciously edited and full of wholesome
and instructive matter presented in an attractive style. This
periodical has been hailed with enthusiastic appreciation. We
have reason to believe that it is very generally read. Regret
has been expressed when we felt obliged to curtail the number
distributed. Calls are numerous these days, and our charitable
friends are straining their resources to the utmost to meet the
various demands for worthy purposes. Should this work, however,
appeal especially to any of our friends, we will gladly apply
any funds for this specific purpose.</p>

OF PENNSYLVANIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">The County Industrial Farm, Workhouse and
Reformatory Act of 1917.</span></p>


<p>Under this Act the State is to be divided into Nine Districts,
in each of which is to be established an Industrial Farm to which
prisoners sentenced to serve terms in county jails are to be sent.
Each Institution is to be managed by a Board of Trustees which
shall be composed of one county commissioner from each county
of the district, to be appointed by the judge of Quarter Sessions.</p>

<p>The members of the first Board of Trustees shall be appointed
to serve until the expiration of their respective terms
of office as county commissioners. Each Board of Trustees is
hereby authorized to select a suitable site for such Industrial
Farm and to make arrangements for the erection and equipment
of the necessary buildings. The Farm is not to exceed five hundred
acres in extent. The buildings are to be “plain and inexpensive
in character,” and the labor as far as possible is to be
supplied by the convicts committed to said institution.</p>

<p>The ninth section of the Act provides that the court of
Quarter Sessions in any county “may, in its discretion, transfer
from the county jails and prisons, respectively, to such penal
farm those who have been sentenced to the county prison for
any crime, misdemeanor, or felony (murder and voluntary manslaughter
excepted),” and also those detained for non-payment
of fines and costs, or for non-support; in fact, any persons legally
confined in the county jails except those who are held for trial.
And hereafter the court may, in its discretion, send those convicted
as above directly to said Industrial Farm.</p>


<p class="ph4">Resources of the Site.</p>

<p>As far as practicable the selection of the site for the farm
shall have reference to its advantages for various forms of
husbandry, fruit-growing, stock-raising, for brick-making, for
the preparation of road and paving material, and shall have good
railroad, drainage, sewage and water facilities. The prisoners
are to be employed in work “on or about the buildings and farm”
in raising stock and supplies for the use of said institution and for
the use of other public and charitable institutions in the District.</p>

<p>“All road material, brick, tile and concrete prepared” at these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
farms not needed for the purposes of the institution, shall be
offered for sale at a price to be fixed by the Board of Trustees,
the proceeds to be applied towards paying the overhead expenses
of said institution.</p>


<p class="ph4">Discipline.</p>

<p>“All inmates shall be clothed and treated as provided for in
this Act, and in the rules and regulations of the industrial farm.”</p>


<p class="ph4">Penalties.</p>

<p>“If any person refuses to perform the work assigned to
him or her, or is guilty of other acts of insubordination, the
superintendent shall punish such person by close confinement
and a diet of bread and water only, or in such other manner as
the rules and regulations ... may prescribe.”</p>

<p>A separate apartment in the institution shall be appropriated
to inebriates and drug users which shall be called the Inebriate
Home. Any person habitually addicted to intemperance or to
“dope” may on application be admitted to this Inebriate Home,
the bills for expense being paid weekly by such applicant. It is
further provided that if any inmate of this Home is able to pay
the expense of his keeping, the court committing such person
is authorized to make an order directing the amount to be paid
by the said inmate.</p>


<p class="ph4">Expense.</p>

<p>The original cost of the farm and buildings and all fixed
overhead charges “shall be paid by the counties constituting the
district, in the ratio of their population according to the last
preceding United States census.” “The cost of the care and
maintenance of the inmates shall be certified monthly to the
counties from which inmates have been committed. Such cost
shall be paid by the counties in proportion to the number of
inmates committed from each county.”</p>


<p class="ph4">NOTES AND COMMENTS ON THIS ACT.</p>

<p>On first reading there were some provisions of the Act which
seemed impracticable. But we believe these minor imperfections
may easily be corrected by future legislative enactment. The
general principle of the Act is sound and in accordance with the
trend of public sentiment. Massachusetts and Indiana both have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Industrial Farms for prisoners serving short-time sentences. The
State of Indiana has one such farm in successful operation, but
we are informed some officials are convinced that it would have
been wiser to institute two or three such farms. The original
bill we favored provided for six such plantations. However, the
nine farms may each have over 500 inmates to be cared for and
employed.</p>

<p>It may be unfortunate that the farms are limited to 500 acres.
Allegheny County now has a farm of over 600 acres, and has
under cultivation about 500 acres. This county will be united
with four other counties in the management of the Industrial
Farm for the Second District, and 500 acres will prove insufficient.
It may be wise to amend the Act making it possible to
secure a farm of 1000 acres if thought desirable. It has been
found to be an economical proposition to establish penal farms
on waste land and by means of drainage, leveling, removing of
rocks and scientific tillage and fertilizing to make the “wilderness
blossom as the rose.” On a Penal Farm in Florida may
now be seen flourishing corn and cane fields where three years
ago was the lair of alligators. At Occoquan, Va., Warden Whittaker
has transformed barren, arid, scrub pine lands, costing from
five to fifteen dollars per acre, into a splendid plantation abounding
in orchards, grain fields, gardens and small fruits. Similarly
very cheap land at Bridgwater, Mass., has been cleared off and
changed into a handsome productive farm.</p>

<p>It might be easier to limit the amount of money to be expended
for the site, the only condition being that the farm should
contain at least 500 acres.</p>


<p class="ph4">Escapes.</p>

<p>Escapes were quite numerous from the Indiana State Farm
when they first were trying the experiment. The passage of a
State law severely penalizing the man who escapes (he is nearly
always caught), justly punishing him with several years of imprisonment
at the State Penitentiary has lessened the number
making effort to escape.</p>


<p class="ph4">Prisoners Awaiting Trial.</p>

<p>Some of these prisoners are held from thirty to ninety days.
Why not allow them the option of languishing in idleness at the
detention prison or of engaging in healthful occupation on the
farm? The option should be given, as they can not be compelled
to work. Such privilege should be granted with circumspection.
The Court not generally being in session when such offenders are
arrested could not pass judgment as to whether such privilege
should be granted. The nature of the accusation must be taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
into consideration. We are sure that a goodly number of those
who are thus held might be sent to the Industrial Farm, but the
details connected with such permission are yet to be arranged.</p>


<p class="ph4">Compensation.</p>

<p>Nothing is said in the Act with regard to any compensation.
It is expected that these farms will ultimately become self-supporting
and may to some extent become a source of profit. We
think it is within the province of the Board of Trustees to fix
the compensation. An addition to the Act as soon as practicable
should be enacted providing for compensation to be sent, part
to the family, if in need, of the prisoner, and a part to be held
for the prisoner at the time of his discharge. The wages will
be graded with reference to the character of the labor. It is a
wise provision of the law that the labor of prisoners in the construction
of the buildings shall be availed of as far as possible.</p>


<p class="ph4">Industries.</p>

<p>On a farm of 500 acres containing tillable land and stone
quarries, a large number of men may find employment, but it
will require very intensive farming to employ 500 men and make
the venture financially profitable. Hence on every farm some one
or two industries should be allowed not requiring highly-skilled
labor, since the population is a rapidly shifting crowd. The bill
very properly specifies brick, tile and concrete work, and the
crushing of stone for road-making. A large number of men
may be thus employed, but please remember that there are nine
of these penal farms. There should be one or two industries
suitable for mechanics and for indoor employment on each farm.
The sale of the products should not be confined to the district
in which any farm is situated. Let the soap-making industry
be established on one of these farms. The product might be
sold to all public institutions in the State. In one or two farms,
there might be found the broom-making industry. In several
farms canneries, under the best sanitary regulations, should be
established. Underwear and socks for all public institutions
could be made at two or three of these penal farms. Working
shirts and overalls are properly made at such institutions. The
manufacture of plain cloth of several inconspicuous patterns
should be encouraged. One factory could make cloth sufficient
for the other nine institutions. Ash cans and garbage cans for all
municipalities are products of prison labor in several States.</p>

<p>We have by no means exhausted the list of industries suitable
for the labor of prisoners. Every suggestion as mentioned
above has been tried and found to work satisfactorily elsewhere.</p>

<p>In all cases, especially with regard to farm products and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
canned goods, it should be specified that the surplus may be sold
in the open market. Suppose more potatoes should chance to be
raised than the public institutions should need. In these days
we tolerate no waste. We doubt whether there is a farmer in
the Commonwealth who would object to the sale of the surplus
in the open market. The competition would be negligible, as we
think it would be with any other industry.</p>


<p class="ph4">Inebriate Home.</p>

<p>It is specified that each of these farms shall have a separate
apartment in the institution for the treatment of inebriates and
drug users. What becomes of the proposition to establish a
State Farm for the care of inebriates? Just such an institution
was authorized by the Assembly of 1913. If this farm is established,
and if nine other Inebriate Homes are to be constructed,
it might seem that an appalling amount of dipsomania and anesthetic
torpor is found in Pennsylvania. We suppose the intent
of the Act is to retain, until cured, or greatly improved, those
unfortunate wretches who spend a large part of the year in
durance in thirty-day and sixty-day sentences. Philadelphia
can supply a thousand of such derelicts, possibly Pittsburgh
another thousand, and the remainder of the State a goodly proportion.
Many of these people can do good work when not under
the influence of intoxicants. We doubt the wisdom of segregation
in every instance. If they mingle freely with those who are
not drunkards or addicted to opiates, they may derive some
benefit from such association. The separate treatment should
be reserved for those who have become greatly impaired by bad
habits.</p>

<p>There is also very great need of providing separate quarters
for those afflicted with tuberculosis and venereal disease.</p>


<p class="ph4">Expenses.</p>

<p>Original cost of farm and buildings paid by counties according
to population. Overhead expenses to be paid by counties according
to population. Care and maintenance of inmates to be
paid by counties for each inmate sent. Each county pays for
transportation of its inmates to the institution. The transportation
of the convict when discharged will be charged, so it appears,
to overhead expenses of the institution.</p>

<p>Thus, every county will pay pro rata according to population
a share of the expense of purchasing the land and erecting
the buildings, also the same proportionate share of the net expense
of conducting the institution, or of the amount left when
receipts are deducted from the expenditures. It is to be hoped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
that at some time the receipts may exceed the expenditures. In
that event we suppose the balance will be credited pro rata to
each county, though the Act is silent on this point.</p>

<p>In addition every county will pay transportation, care and
maintenance of its own inmates. No inmates, nothing to pay on
this head.</p>

<p>It will require an expert in institutional management and in
bookkeeping to determine just what items should be charged
to care and maintenance, and to general expenses. What difference
will it make? Simply this. Some counties naturally will
send a smaller proportionate number of inmates than others. A
few counties may have but one or two inmates during the year.
Each county will receive two bills for payment. One will be for
its share of overhead expenses. The other will cover the cost
of maintaining the prisoners sent from said county. If certain
charges which might be debited to care and maintenance are
charged against overhead or general expenses, then the auditor
of the county sending few or no prisoners will justly protest
a system of bookkeeping which charges to general expenses what
ought to be charged to care and maintenance. Questions will
arise quite difficult to decide, hence, there should be some regulations
adopted of universal application to the nine institutions.</p>


<p class="ph4">Discretionary Power of the Court.</p>

<p>According to this Act, the Court “<i>may</i>, in its discretion,
sentence” a convicted offender to the county jail, to the Industrial
Farm, or to any penal institution legally entitled to receive
convicts. We repose much confidence in the judiciary of this
State. But we trust that they will agree to send all convicts,
sentenced from forty days to two years, or to whatever time
they think it advisable to send them to the State Prisons, to these
Industrial Farms. They may exercise an option below twenty
days, depending on the proximity of said farm. Allegheny
County sends hundreds of prisoners, sentenced for ten days and
less, about ten miles away to the Industrial Farm. Philadelphia
transports likewise a large number of short termers about fifteen
miles to the House of Correction on its farm of several hundred
acres. The State of Indiana makes its obligatory to send all
convicted of misdemeanors, who are sentenced to sixty days or
more, to the State Industrial Farm. The option of the Court
may be exercised when the sentence is less than sixty days.</p>

<p>In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania there is no team
work with reference to the place where convicts may be incarcerated.
Some counties, especially the smaller ones, have
an understanding that all prisoners sentenced to one year or
more should be dispatched to the penitentiary. In other counties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
a person may serve a sentence of twenty years in the county
prison. How would this schedule work?</p>

<p class="ph4">Possible Objections.</p>

<p>Some county officials may point with pride to their prison,
perhaps rather recently constructed, with admirable sanitary
features, and affording some opportunity for employment. What
is to become of such plants? We know of no county prison in
the State whose facilities would be equivalent to the advantages
afforded by the farm. Some prison will be needed at every
county seat as a place of detention. Portions of the real estate
may sometimes be sold for a handsome sum, or used for some
other public purpose. We know of very few county prisons for
whose construction we entertain much respect. Most of these
jails need entire renovation. Some of the newer type resemble
cages for animals—a type of building we condemn.</p>

<p>The latest ward constructed in the Philadelphia County
Prison at Holmesburg embodies some of the best features of
modern prison construction. We should regret to have this
disused. The latest cell-block at the Allegheny County Workhouse
is a model of its kind. And the new dining room at this
institution is admirable from every point of view. Our private
suggestion is that the Trustees of the Second District, in which
five counties are comprised including Allegheny, shall arrange to
take over this Penal Farm, or the Allegheny County Workhouse,
and constitute it as the Industrial Farm for this District. The
buildings and the land are already there, and an efficient institution
conducted now on the lines enumerated in the Act establishing
these Industrial Farms. The other counties of the District
have been for some time sending their convicts to this workhouse,
paying Allegheny County a per diem rate for each prisoner
sent from their respective counties.</p>

<p>We wish we could devise a satisfactory scheme for the
consolidation of the counties of the First District in which
Philadelphia County is located.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Do we dare to suggest the pooling of the interests of the
House of Correction and the County Prison at Holmesburg so
that the two prisons may be combined under the same management,
thus making the Correctional Farm available for both
institutions? Can more land be secured, or reclaimed from the
marshes of the Delaware?</p>

<p>In the State of Indiana the general expenses and the overhead
expenses are paid by the State. The counties pay 55 cents
daily therefore for each convict sent. It is justly argued that
as all indictments charge the offender with violating the peace
and dignity of the State, the State should assume responsibility
for its own protection. In the Act now under consideration, it
is provided distinctly that the various counties of each District
are to be responsible for the expenses on some pro rata basis.
The taxpayers of the State will pay the bills whether paid by
State or counties. We believe on consideration there will be some
advantage derived from the financial policy as proposed in this
bill. It will undoubtedly happen that some farms under more
expert management will tend to become self-supporting or to
reduce the overhead expense to a small figure.</p>

<p>The counties of such a District will be subject to comparatively
slight taxation for the support of the prison. Information
will promptly spread to the other Districts, so that the Trustees
will seek that kind of an administrator who can show the best
results. Friendly emulation should work no evil. There is one
cautionary word. Some administrator, who has more ambition
to make a good financial showing than to adopt reformatory measures,
may be tempted to exploit the men under his charge to
their detriment. A superintendent should be chosen, not only
for business ability but also to inspire the inmates with higher
ideals of life. He will get the best out of his men by allowing
certain privileges and compensation for faithful effort. Any other
sort of manager should be removed.</p>


<p class="ph4">Rules and Regulations.</p>

<p>The regulations of each one of the Industrial Farms are to
be framed by the Trustees of said farm. It is specifically provided
that the duties of the officers, the clothing and treatment of
the inmates, the penalties for insubordination, the government
of the Inebriate Home, shall be prescribed by the Trustees.</p>

<p>We believe it will be found advisable for the Trustees of
these various institutions to meet and formulate some general
regulations. We advise that the Act be amended so that meetings
may be held at least once each year. In fact, several meetings
should be held prior to the operation of these farms in
order that the same principle may obtain in regard to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
management. Each Local Board should have ample leeway to
make rules according to the particular needs and environment
of the individual farms, but it is very essential that a uniform
policy should be adopted with regard to certain features.</p>

<ol>
<li>Industries. Care should be taken that the specific industries
should not be duplicated. For instance, soap-making should
be assigned to one of the institutions, not on a large scale by all
of them. Certain manufactures may be more economically conducted
where water power may be readily obtained.</li>

<li>Clothing. We trust no form of degrading conspicuous
dress may be found at any institution. It is possible for some
Board to require the stripes which have been generally discontinued.</li>

<li>Penalties. Section 10 prescribes that the superintendent
shall punish a refractory prisoner by close confinement and a diet
of bread and water only, “or in such manner as the rules and
regulations ... may prescribe.” We submit that corporal
punishment of any description should be abolished. It would
be possible for some Board of Trustees to sanction the whipping
post or the hose treatment—penalties which belong to a
barbaric age. We suggest that the Trustees limit punishments
to confinement, restricted diet, deprivation of privileges and
reasonable fines, and if such measures prove unavailing the
culprit should be remanded to the county jail.</li>

<li>Bookkeeping. Uniformity is highly desirable. The
greatest care should be taken to discriminate as to what expenses
belong to the general upkeep of the institution and to the care
and maintenance of the prisoners. The estimate of the charges
to each county is to be based upon such discrimination.</li>
</ol>

<p>Uniformity in a few other matters may be desirable, but
care should be taken not to hamper the individual Boards by
general rules about petty affairs.</p>


<p class="ph4">Conclusion.</p>

<p>We have dwelt to some extent upon the possible defects of
this law which, however, has admirable features. In any achievement,
involving as many changes as are contemplated in this
Act, there will be difficulties encountered. At first we were
inclined to see lions in the way, but when we see the effect of
the conversion of compulsory idleness into productive efficiency,
we may conclude that the difficulties are not insurmountable.</p>

<p>We trust that some Board may soon take action and inaugurate
this work, which is one of the greatest reformatory movements
known in the penological annals of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. We very much hope that next season may find
at least one of these institutions in actual operation.</p>

<p class="ph4">PAYMENT OF COSTS AND FINES BY INSTALMENTS.</p>

<p>Act No. 111, approved by the Governor, May 17, 1917,
grants permission to any Court or sentencing authority to dismiss
any person held for non-payment of fines and costs on condition
of agreeing to pay said charges by instalments.</p>

<p>In previous publications of this Society, it has been shown
that the practice in the 67 counties of the Commonwealth is far
from uniform. The law of 1836, except for first offenders, is
still in force, which prescribes that when a fine is $15.00 or less
the defendant may be detained 30 days in prison; if the fine is
more than $15.00, the term of imprisonment is 90 days. Comparatively
few counties observed this regulation. Many counties
detained the prisoner as many days as there were dollars
in the fine.</p>

<p>Some counties have already profited by availing themselves
of the privilege of Act No. 111. In one county the sum of
$2600.00 had been collected in fines on the instalment plan in
less than three months. Formerly the county collected nothing,
and in addition maintained the prisoner who was detained in
idleness. If the prisoner thus detained could do any service to
the county in the line of road-making or other useful employment,
his detention would be considered sensible. To present
him with board and lodging for a hundred days with no employment,
because he owes the county a hundred dollars, is an
absurdity.</p>

<p>The privilege of paying the fine and costs in instalments
ought to inure to the benefit of all parties concerned.</p>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Employment of Prisoners on County or Almshouse Farms.</span></p>

<p>Act No. 337, approved by the Governor, July 17, 1917, authorizes
the employment of convicts at the county jails “at agricultural
labor on any county or almshouse farm of the county
... by the poor authorities of such county under the direction
of the warden.” Section 2 of the Act releases the warden
from liability in case of the escape of said convicts while thus
employed, if due care has been exercised.</p>

<p>The beauty of this Act consists in the fact that it can be
immediately put into execution. No formal meeting of Boards
is necessary to consider the matter. No expense is required for
buildings and land. This enactment is exactly in line with Act
No. 359, Laws of Pennsylvania, 1915, providing for the employment
of prisoners at road-making. The law of 1915 provides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
for the payment of wages to those thus employed and
forbids the wearing of stripes. We infer that no conspicuous
degrading dress is to be worn. We hope that under the present
Act, no degrading costume will be imposed upon the workers
and that some compensation shall be given.</p>

<p>Already the counties are reaping benefit from this recent
enactment. But with next season we believe many of the counties
will avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by this
Act. Some counties have taken immediate action. The following
reports have been received showing what has been accomplished.
However, in several of these counties the Court had
previously to the passage of this legislation granted special parole
to certain prisoners in order that they might be employed on
farms. The passage of this law, however, will make it vastly
easier to place the men on farms. The machinery of parole is
sometimes a little cumbersome.</p>

<p>Fayette County. Men work on roads and farms. Wages
daily, 25 cents. It is estimated that the county saves many thousand
dollars annually by working the convicts on the roads.</p>

<p>Some further details of what has been accomplished in the
way of producing supplies for the prisons may be found in the
Report of the Wardens’ meeting at Glen Mills.</p>

<p>About half of the counties of the State have a prison population
per diem of fifteen or less, possibly the majority of these
detained for trial; hence, the farming proposition has little interest
for them.</p>

<p>This law will be extremely beneficial to the prisons wherever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
it is properly applied. Calculate, if you please, what the
labor of ten men on any well managed farm will produce. Nothing
whatever is said in the law as to the distribution of the
produce. The crop may be divided on some equitable basis with
the poor authorities. It may all go to the prison on some terms
to be agreed upon. What cannot be used at the time may be
canned for use in the winter. We suppose in some cases the
surplus may be sold, or exchanged for other necessities of the
institution.</p>

<p>The law at least may be commended for brevity and for
the absence of any restraining features. Credit must be given
to the State Board of Charities for proposing and at once securing
the passage of this economic measure. The law is to be in
force during the continuance of the present war.</p>

<p>We trust the law will be amended so that the prisoners may
be allowed to work on land leased or donated for such purpose.
There are some large counties where there is no land available
for this laudable purpose. The bill introduced by Mr. Walker
of Philadelphia contained such a provision and also a clause
explicitly stating that the surplus of products may be sold at the
best prices obtainable.</p>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Commission To Propose a Revised System of Prison
Management.</span></p>

<p>Act No. 409 provides “That the Governor is hereby duly
authorized to appoint a commission of five persons, two of whom
shall be learned in the law, and at least one of whom shall be an
active official of a correctional institution within this Commonwealth,
to investigate prison systems and the organization and
management of correctional institutions within this Commonwealth
and elsewhere; to recommend such revision of the existing
prison system within this Commonwealth, and the laws pertaining
to the establishment, maintenance and regulation of State
and county correctional institutions within this Commonwealth,
as it shall deem wise, and to report the same to the General
Assembly at the session of 1919.” Another section of the Act
provides for the appropriation of the sum of Five Thousand
Dollars in order to meet the necessary expenses of this commission,
incurred in the performance of their duties.</p>

<p>The Commission has been appointed and has already begun
the work of investigation. Two of the members attended the sessions
of the American Prison Association at New Orleans and
by interviews with penological experts, both administrators and
students, derived valuable suggestions in regard to the special
features of penal management which should be carefully studied
in other States. The Commission aims to proceed with great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
caution, being aware that what may have been successful in some
States may be unsuited to conditions in other States. While its
members have authorized no statement of its aims for publication,
it may be safely stated that there is no desire to effect a
revolution in our present system, but to modify and add to the
present regulations so as to attain the highest efficiency consistent
with right and justice. The Commission is unanimous in the
belief that employment must be found for all prisoners in the
State and county prisons. There are some conflicting elements
with regard to the question of prison labor, and it will be the
aim of the Commission to devise some system of employment
which may as far as possible be helpful to the prisoner, when he
is discharged, which may teach him self-respect, and the duties
and responsibilities of citizenship, and which may reduce the
administrative expenses to a minimum, even to the extent of
making our penal institutions self-supporting. To accomplish
this desirable purpose, the law of 1913 providing for the manufacture
of articles for State-use must be greatly strengthened;
and the establishment of two or three industries for the manufacture
of articles or the production of material for State-Account
must be seriously considered. We are aware that the
relations of prison labor to other labor must be thoughtfully and
considerately observed so that the interests of all parties may be
conserved. We submit that when several thousand men are
thrown out of employment or are detained in idleness, the entire
community sustains a loss. On this subject the Commission will
welcome any suggestions from officials or any persons interested
in this important matter.</p>

<p>The Commission is composed as follows:</p>

<p>Fletcher W. Stites, Chairman, Crozer Building, Philadelphia.
(Attorney and Member of the Assembly of 1917).</p>

<p>A. E. Jones, Attorney, Uniontown, Pa.</p>

<p>Mrs. Martha P. Falconer, Superintendent Girls’ House of
Refuge, Darling P. O., Pa.</p>

<p>Louis N. Robinson, Professor of Economics, Swarthmore
College, Pa.</p>

<p>Albert H. Votaw, Secretary The Pennsylvania Prison Society,
Philadelphia.</p>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">State-use System.</span></p>

<p>Several bills were introduced in the late Assembly designed
to strengthen the Act of 1915 in regard to the manufacture of
articles by prisoners for the use of the public institutions, but
we regret to report that, save the reference of these bills to committees,
no action was taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>We admit some friction in getting the various public institutions
in any State to agree to purchase prison-made articles,
yet in those States where such system has been in use for some
years, there is little tendency to take a backward step. Unless
there is a provision that public institutions shall, whenever practicable,
procure their supplies from the Prison Labor Commission,
little progress can be made. Everybody agrees that prisoners
ought to be put to work, and that it is a shame to detain
them in utter idleness, but when it comes to using the products
of their industry, there is reluctance and a feeling that the other
fellow may use such goods.</p>

<p>We are glad to report that the Prison Labor Commission
of Pennsylvania has made a beginning, yet up to this time the
output is far below the capacity of the available workers. At
the Huntingdon Reformatory, the license tags for automobiles
to the number of one million are being made, a decidedly economical
arrangement for the State. Brushes, mops and brooms
are made at the Western Penitentiary and at the Eastern Penitentiary
a shoe factory has been initiated, and also knit goods
are made in this institution. We believe that a business of a
million dollars yearly may be built up in this State with prison-made
goods, and in order to make this worth while, the State
should make ample provision for the administration of this
proposition. No State has been successful in establishing the
State-Use system which did not make it obligatory upon the
public institutions to patronize the industries established by the
State. It goes without saying that the quality of the goods or
articles made in these penal institutions must be satisfactory.</p>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Capital Punishment.</span></p>

<p>The Acting Committee gave hearty support to the bill for
the abolition of Capital Punishment, and deeply regret that this
relic of a barbarous revengeful age is to be continued in this
Commonwealth.</p>

<p>The bill passed the Senate by a handsome majority, and
there was every indication that it would pass the House with
votes to spare. A day or two before the vote was taken, there
was an explosion in a munition factory near Chester, which at
first was thought to have been caused by spies or alien enemies.
Great loss of life resulted, and the idea that such a heinous crime
could not be punished by death, if the bill should be passed, so
wrought upon the minds of the members of the Assembly that
many of them changed their attitude, casting their votes against
the bill. This shocking accident was never traced to the agency
of any person or persons; however, it was felt by many that
in the event of the commission of such a crime, death was the
only adequate penalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">The Indeterminate Sentence.</span></p>

<p>A law for the imposition of a maximum and a minimum
term of imprisonment on convicts sent to the penitentiaries of
the State was passed in 1909. It was provided that the minimum
should not exceed one-fourth the maximum sentence.</p>

<p>In 1911 the law was amended to apply to convicts of the
State when sent to the penitentiary or to the county jail. It
was further amended by striking out the one-fourth provision
and vesting the authority to determine the maximum and minimum
entirely in the Court, except that the maximum was not
to be greater than the law for any particular offence may prescribe.
The Court has power by this law to make the minimum
sentence any time at all to within one day of the maximum. A
convict whose offence by statute may be punished by an imprisonment
of twenty years could have a minimum sentence fixed at
any time from one day to nineteen years, eleven months and
twenty-nine days. There were four prisoners at the Eastern
Penitentiary at the time the last report was made whose maximum
was twenty years and whose minimum was the same lacking
one day. There were thirty-eight prisoners sentenced to a maximum
of twenty years whose minimum was eighteen years or
more. According to the old law of commutation for good behavior,
every one of these prisoners would have been entitled
to freedom on good behavior at the end of twelve years and
three months. This law of commutation for satisfactory conduct
had been in vogue for fifty years and we have not learned that
the judiciary of the State had issued any remonstrance. The
number according to the last report whose maximum was twenty
years was 86. These under old law of commutation might be released
in 12 years, 3 months. Of these 86, under present law, 55
will remain longer than under commutation. And under present
law, 31 may be released earlier than under commutation. It
is the inequality of sentences which has produced dissatisfaction.
We have confidence in the judiciary of the Commonwealth, but
we know that they differ in regard to time of expiation. How
could it be otherwise? It might be supposed that judges might
welcome an opportunity to place the responsibility of determining
the time of release, or of ascertaining when a convict is
ready to resume the duties of citizenship, upon some judicious
body of men or women chosen with regard to their special fitness
for such a responsible task.</p>

<p>The Assembly was convinced of the righteousness of the
plea for an indeterminate sentence which might more closely
correspond with its title than the law as amended in 1911, hence
the members of the Assembly by a solid majority amended the
law of 1911 so that any convict who had served one-third of the
maximum sentence as prescribed by the Court should be eligible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
for parole. Mark that the law explicitly states that such
convicts are <i>eligible</i> for parole, <i>not</i> that they <i>shall</i> be paroled.
The time when they should be paroled, if paroled under any
event, is decided by the Parole Board. Granted that we have
a judicious Parole Board, who can better decide when a man is
entitled to liberty, the judge or the jury who note the crime and
see the man at the time of his trial, or the men who are supposed
not only to know the circumstances of the crime but also to
become familiar with the man’s attitude and general character?
In this country freedom is man’s birthright, and if by some error
or mischance he loses that liberty, it should be restored to him as
soon as he shows that he can safely be trusted with it, and that
he appreciates its value.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the favorable vote of both Houses of
the Assembly, Governor Brumbaugh was not convinced of the
correctness of the principle involved and so interposed a veto.
With all due deference to the Chief Magistrate of this Commonwealth,
we honestly differ with him in regard to this particular
matter. The veto message was quite brief, the fear being expressed
that some guilty of second degree murder, altho the circumstances
might readily indicate a malicious murder of the
first degree, might under the proposed act regain their freedom
in something less than seven years. The statute provides a sentence
of twenty years for murder of the second degree, but under
the operation of the proposed amendment the guilty person
would be liable for parole at the end of six years and eight
months.</p>

<p>It seems to be forgotten that the Parole Board exercises
judicial functions, and very often refuses parole when the minimum
time has expired. Eligibility to parole is far from synonymous
with election to parole. The circumstances are closely
investigated, and the record of the trial is carefully studied. In
the case of any outrageous murder or burglary, the Board of
Parole is amply justified in detaining the applicant beyond the
time of the minimum sentence. In many cases the Board has
very properly refused the application for parole and in a number
of instances has decided it best to retain a criminal to the end
of his maximum term.</p>

<p>Granted that the Parole Board may occasionally err on the
side of mercy, the wrong, sorrow, misery caused by the failure
to secure this legislation will far outweigh the possible danger
from the very few who might be prematurely returned to the
outside world. Today the Commonwealth is supporting in almost
complete idleness some hundreds who have demonstrated
that they are ready to resume citizenship and to support themselves
and families and yet they are compelled to remain as a
burden to the community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>We are placing an immense burden upon the Inspectors of
our Penitentiaries who in this State constitute the Boards of
Parole. They are men with a high sense of civic responsibility,
who do a large amount of faithful service without financial
remuneration. They will not ask for any release from duties
which the State may impose on them, but in justice to them we
submit that the time has come for at least consideration of a
proposition to appoint a special Board of Parole who shall
receive compensation for their services. The work, if properly
performed, demands a large amount of care and study.</p>


<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Employment of Prisoners on the Highways.</span></p>

<p>Act 314 empowers the State Highway Commissioner to arrange
with the managers of prisons to employ the inmates thereof
at manual labor for “the construction ... or maintenance of
the State Highways....”</p>

<p>The workers are to receive wages from 40 to 60 cents per
day, and are to be subjected to no cruel treatment.</p>

<p>The law is an excellent one and should result, since there
is great scarcity of laborers, in very great benefit to the Commonwealth,
in fact, in the settlement of the good roads problem.</p>

<p>Recently the Rhode Island Legislature has made it possible
to employ convict labor on the public highways. Two gangs of
thirty-one men each were thus employed last summer, and it is
reported that the results are very satisfactory to the road officials.</p>

<p>Missouri has also joined the ranks of States that use convict
labor in the construction of highways. “The Old Trail highway,
running from Kansas City to St. Louis, is being improved
... over a stretch of swampy land that has been the despair
of the Old Trail highway promoters, and the work is being done
entirely with convict labor under the direction of State engineers.”</p>

<p>The subject of food supply is engaging the attention of the
nation. There are a hundred million mouths to feed in this country,
and we have undertaken to feed almost that number abroad.
Hence we need to study the actual value of various foods and to
eliminate all waste.</p>

<p>Not only the food value of the daily menu is to be considered
but the preparation of the food is of vital consequence. I am
fortunately able to give a concrete instance of the importance
and economical value of a scientific method in the selection and
preparation of a dinner for a company of 1200 prisoners. I
was visiting recently a large prison farm in one of the Southern
States. The superintendent had just indicated his progressive
spirit by employing a skilled institutional dietitian to spend a few
days in their culinary department. Orders were issued for the
cooking force to obey implicitly the instructions of the temporary
chef.</p>


<p>Two Prison Menus.</p>

<p>The day before he took charge the following stew had been
prepared, the method being much the same as in nine-tenths of the
public institutions of the United States. The ingredients were
as follows:</p>


<table class="autotable">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">874 lbs. beef @ 12c.</td>
<td class="tdr">$104.88</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">200 lbs. rice @ 8c.</td>
<td class="tdr">16.00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">&#160;</td>
<td class="tdl">————</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Total cost</td>
<td class="tdr">$120.88</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>“In this stew the meat was put on, bone and all, in hot water
and stewed for about two hours; then it was dipped out and the
rice was boiled in the liquor which remained. The meat was
tough and unpalatable, and the rice worse, many of the prisoners
saying that altho they had not tasted beef for more than a month
they could not eat it.” After the meal large quantities of the
meat was gathered up for the garbage can.</p>

<p>The day previous to my visit, under this dietitian the following
ingredients were used for a stew:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>


<table class="autotable">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">390 lbs. beef @ 12c.</td>

<p>“The beef was cut clean from all the bones and cut into
small one-inch cubes. It was then put in equal quantities in five
thirty-gallon kettles and these were then filled to about two-thirds
their depth with cold water at 4 A. M. This was kept simmering
till 10 A. M. when the sliced onions were added. At 10.30 the
pepper, salt and potatoes were added, and then the dumplings
which had been prepared were added, care being taken not to
place enough in any one pot at one time to bring it below the
boiling point, always putting on the lids immediately in order to
prevent the cold air from making the dumplings heavy. The
dumplings were a great success considering the crude equipment,
and were made as follows:</p>

<p>“Forty lbs. of flour, 2&#189; lbs. baking powder, 5 lbs. lard.
The flour and baking powder were rubbed together until thoroly
incorporated, then very cold water was added until the mass was
of sufficient thickness for rolling. It was then rolled into sheets
one-half inch thick and cut in semi-circular or crescent shapes
with a biscuit cutter and added to the stew as above stated. The
secret of light dumplings is to see that boiling is uninterrupted,
and that the cover is put on immediately after they are put in,
and that it be kept on for twenty minutes to hold in the heat
which is over the surface of the liquid. It is this top heat which
expands the gas produced by the baking powder and also cooks
the dough.... Thirty-two cans of strong beef broth were
obtained from the bones and were canned. The bones were
steadily boiled for many hours and the fat was from time to time
skimmed off. Several gallons of fat were thus obtained, which,
having been clarified, were used later in seasoning a mess of
green beans. The broth was sent to the hospital.”</p>

<p>I have given the formula and also the method of preparation
as it was reported in order that the care involved might be
shown. There is no lack of help at any of our penal institutions,
so that the additional time and labor may not be taken into account.</p>

<p>The next day a pork stew was prepared and was also hailed
with enthusiasm. The pigs which were fattening on the contents
of the garbage pails lamented the advent of the chef. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
was universal commendation of the mess which was served.
Happiness reigned. Smiling faces were seen everywhere.</p>

<p>The difference in cost of the two meals was $57.98 in favor
of the toothsome meal.</p>

<p>Let us estimate the saving at $50.00 per day.</p>

<p>Saving in one week $350.00. Saving in 52 weeks $18,200.
If thus an institution may save $18,000 annually, is it not wise
economy to employ an expert dietitian?</p>

<p>But we must not be carried off our feet by mere figures.
The actual value of the two meals, one prepared by the old haphazard
method, the other in accordance with the true principles
of cookery, must be compared.</p>

<p>The beef and rice stew in actual units of food values exceeds
the value of the dumpling meal. But the satisfaction afforded
by the dumpling meal would carry an almost unanimous vote
in its favor.</p>

<p>Let the dumpling meal have about 200 lbs. of meat added,
and there will still be a saving of about $36.00 per dinner, or
$13,180 annually.</p>

<p>My contention is that it will be wise for all institutions to
consider methods of preparation both for the sake of the health
and happiness of the inmates, and for economy.</p>


<p class="ph4">Employment of a Chef.</p>

<p>Recently I visited a large penal institution near Boston,
Mass., where a food expert had been employed for more than
a year. The experiment was overwhelmingly successful. Formerly
the food was prepared altogether under the care of inmates,
some of whom were more or less acquainted with cooking
and serving, generally less familiar. Men were coming and
going, hence there was irregular service in the kitchen, and often
novices rendered the food unpalatable. The authorities wisely
employed a head chef who should direct the work of the bakery
and kitchen. The result amply justified the experiment. A balanced
ration was served, the food was appetizing, a large variety
appeared on the tables from time to time, the hospital was less
frequented, and the expense of provision had not been increased.
In every way the institution was benefited by the new method.</p>


<p class="ph4">Sing Sing.</p>

<p>The most convincing illustration is from Sing Sing. We
quote from a report made by Dr. George W. Kirchwey who succeeded
Warden Osborne.</p>

<p>“When I assumed the responsibilities of the office of
Warden and began to make a closer study of conditions at Sing
Sing, I was struck by the amount of ill-health and the lack of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
proper medical care of the inmates. The men seemed to be generally
anaemic and undernourished. Many of them were afflicted
with disease of one kind or another. Many of them were
stunted and deformed, and a large number, it seemed to me,
were mentally defective or mentally diseased.</p>

<p>"The first thing to which I turned my attention was the
problem of supplying an adequate and nourishing diet and of
improving the unsanitary and unwholesome conditions under
which the food was prepared and served to the inmates generally.
In this work I had the services of a committee of inmates
and of a food expert, Dr. Emily C. Seaman, of Teachers’ College,
Columbia University. The task was not an easy one, because it
called for something like a revolution in the prison dietary without
increasing the cost, limited to 15 cents a day per man. As
the result of the painstaking work of Dr. Seaman and the food
committee, the quality of the food was so improved that in a
short time the attendance in the mess-hall, which is voluntary,
increased by 40 per cent.</p>

<p>“They are now serving a diet at Sing Sing which is, upon
the whole, satisfactory and comes as near to being a balanced
diet as the means at our disposal will permit. What is needed
is not so much an increased allowance by the legislature for the
purchase of food, as the addition to the prison of an extensive
farm which will furnish eggs, vegetables, milk, pork and other
supplies at reduced cost. Every prison should have such a farm
connected with it. The food reform involved the reconstruction
of the old badly ventilated, ill-smelling mess-hall and the building
of a new kitchen with modern appliances for the preparation of
food, as well as the training of the inmate cooks, waiters, etc., for
their duties.</p>

<p>“The large force of men—about 125—employed in the
preparation and serving of the food are carefully selected and
regularly examined twice a month by the prison physician. The
men are required to keep themselves as neat and clean as waiters
in a respectable outside restaurant. The kitchen is a model
of what an institutional kitchen should be. In the dining hall,
the long slate slabs, miscalled tables, at which the men have been
required to feed for countless years, are being replaced by attractive
tables seating ten each, at which the processes of serving
and eating may go on in a civilized fashion.”</p>


<p class="ph4">Investigation of N. Y. Prison Association.</p>

<p>In the 72d Annual Report of the Prison Association of New
York we find an exhaustive study of the rations at the State
penal institutions. Two assistant secretaries have given a large
amount of time and attention to this matter and we propose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
make some quotations from this report.</p>

<p>“The principal defects may be presented under the following
headings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Insufficiency in the amount of food allotted.</li>

<li>Wrong relative amounts of different classes of food,
making it difficult to serve balanced rations.</li>

<li>Unsatisfactory method of distribution of food among the
prisoners.</li>

<li>Inadequate system of food allotment and estimates at
the central office.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Their observations at Sing Sing confirm the report of
Warden Kirchwey.</p>

<p>“With a view to varying the daily menu as much as possible
a new dietary was established early in the year by Dr. Emily
C. Seaman, of Columbia University. A new kitchen was provided
in what was formerly known as the old boiler room, with
concrete floor, and walls and ceiling enameled white. New
equipment was installed, including potato steamers, aluminum
kettles, steam kettles, an electric meat chopper, electric potato
paring machine, large gas range for roasting meats, and large
coffee urns. Those employed in the kitchen and mess hall are
dressed in white duck suits. Tables with white enameled tops
and chairs with backs are being installed in place of the old tables
and stools. The new arrangement is reported to have improved
the quality and cleanliness of the food served.”</p>


<p class="ph4">A Scientific Ration.</p>

<p>In order to make our contention clear, it seems necessary to
impart some technical information.</p>

<p>The value of food is estimated in calories. A calorie may
be expressed in terms of heat or in terms of work. In the
laboratory and by experimentation with human subjects the value
of all foods has been very scientifically demonstrated. Foods
largely consist of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, which have
the function of supplying the body with energy or the power
to work. The proper proportion of these constituents of food
makes up a <i>balanced ration</i> which satisfies our physical needs in
the way of nourishment. We get our carbohydrates from bread,
fruits, vegetables, sugar and all grain products. Fats are derived
from meats, eggs, butter, milk, nuts, etc. The proteins are derived
from meats, eggs and some vegetables, especially beans.</p>

<p>A calorie in terms of heat is defined as the amount required
to raise one pound of water four degrees Fahrenheit. In terms
of work or physical energy a calorie represents the amount of
food required to lift 100 pounds about 30 feet.</p>

<p>It has been ascertained that the average amount of calories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
required daily is about 3000 calories for a man who takes exercise.
2500 calories are regarded sufficient for a man who does
not take exercise.</p>

<p>Now a good balanced ration for the average man who is
working moderately may be estimated in the following proportion:</p>

<p class="ph4">Dietary for a Prison.</p>

<p>At the request of the Prison Association of New York a
dietary, with cost values, was prepared by Mr. William Golden,
General Inspector and Dietitian of the Department of Correction,
New York City, and Dr. Emily C. Seaman, Instructor in physiology
and chemistry in Teachers’ College, Columbia University.
They suggested a dietary for fourteen consecutive days and made
an estimate of the cost. The average daily cost for each prisoner
was 18.4c, based on prices February, 1917.</p>

<p>As a sample we present their proposed bill of fare for three
alternate days:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Oatmeal with milk and sugar, fruit, bread, coffee
with milk and sugar.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Roast beef, cornstarch pudding, rice, carrots, raisin
sauce, bread, coffee with milk and sugar.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Vermicelli soup, graham bread, tea with sugar.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Puffed wheat with milk and sugar, bread, coffee
with milk and sugar.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Bread, coffee with milk and sugar, salmon, scalloped
rice and tomatoes.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Bread pudding with raisins, bread, tea with sugar.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Rice with syrup, graham bread, coffee with milk
and sugar.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Roast beef, baked potatoes, peas, graham bread,
gelatine, coffee with milk and sugar.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Cornstarch pudding, gingerbread, tea with sugar.</p>

<p>Now the dietary given above was prepared with special reference
to the physical requirements of the human system. The
ingredients are in the correct proportion to insure health and
happiness. Let no one think this menu is extravagant. The
following table presents the exact amounts given to each person
with the cost value. It will surprise many a warden to note that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the total cost is little in excess of the usual monotonous and haphazard
dietary.</p>

<p>The average cost for these three days for each inmate, 16&#189;
cents.</p>

<p>Now this is an imaginary bill of fare, not supposed to be
served in any institution in the world. It is a suggestion of possibilities.
The new service at Sing Sing may approximate to this
list of eatables.</p>


<p class="ph4">Eats in a Michigan Prison.</p>

<p>In the report of the Michigan State Prison for two years
ending June 30, 1916, we find the daily menu for every meal in
a whole year. Twenty-six pages of the report are taken up with
this schedule of eatables.</p>

<p>An extract from this report explains the unusual pains to
publish the bill of fare.</p>

<p>“An old adage states that one of the avenues to a man’s
heart is through his stomach. The now existing system of intensive
farming, and of canning the surplus fruits and vegetables
not consumed by the prison commissary has furnished the Michigan
State Prison with unusual opportunity to supply food
products. The opportunity is reflected in the following menu,
showing the food actually served during the last fiscal year.”</p>

<p>We present the menu for a few days selected from different
times of the year:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Saturday, July 3, 1915.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Oatmeal, milk, sugar, bread, butter, coffee.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Fried pork steak, mashed potatoes, cream gravy,
stewed tomatoes, bread, iced tea, cookies, strawberry shortcake.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Lunch from dinner, bread, coffee.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday, August 1, 1915.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Hot biscuits, syrup, fried potatoes, bread, butter,
coffee.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Roast beef, browned potatoes, beans, lettuce,
radishes, bread, mince pie, iced tea.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Lunch from dinner, bread, coffee.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wednesday, December 15, 1915.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Liver and bacon, steamed potatoes, bread, gravy,
coffee.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Boiled beef, fried parsnips, steamed potatoes,
onions, mashed turnips, tomato pickle, bread.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Bean soup, corn bread, crackers, bread, coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Thursday, February 24, 1916.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Baked hash, gravy, bread, coffee.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Baked beans, pork, syrup, steamed potatoes, bread,
buttermilk.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Rice soup, corn bread, crackers, bread, coffee.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Tuesday, May 23, 1916.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Creamed potatoes, apple jelly, bread, coffee.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Boiled pork, stewed beans, horseradish, mashed
rutabagas, green onions, bread, buttermilk.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Rice soup, rhubarb pie, bread, coffee.</p>

<p>Complete menus are given for 364 days, or for 1092 meals.
No, we were not quoting from the Ritz-Carlton cuisine, but from
the culinary department of a western penal establishment.</p>


<p class="ph4">Elmira Reformatory.</p>

<p>The daily bill of fare at the Elmira Reformatory shows
that the question of the serving and the variety of food has had
careful thought. We quote from a recent report of the State
Commission of Prisons, N. Y.</p>

<p>“This institution has one of the best equipped kitchens in
the State. It is kept scrupulously clean and the waste has been
reduced to a minimum. A physician makes frequent inspections
which include an examination of the inmates employed in the
kitchen and mess halls. Special white suits are provided.”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sunday</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Rolled oats, bread, coffee, syrup.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Beef soup, corned beef, boiled potatoes, bread,
coffee, pudding.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Stewed raisins, spice cake, bread, butter, syrup, tea.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Monday</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Creamed rice, bread, coffee.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Roast beef, brown gravy, potatoes, bread, coffee,

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Roast beef hash, bread, butter, syrup, tea.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Friday</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Breakfast</i>—Rolled oats with milk and sugar, bread, coffee.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dinner</i>—Macaroni with tomato sauce, creamed potatoes, rice
pudding with raisins, bread, coffee.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Supper</i>—Creamed rice, bread, butter, syrup, tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>


<p class="ph4">Albany, N. Y.</p>

<p>From the same report we learn of a more modest menu at
the Albany County Prison. Besides the conventional bread and
coffee served every morning, there was always an additional
article of food. Beginning with Monday in one week, these
articles in consecutive order were oatmeal, hash, rice and syrup,
cornbeef hash, oatmeal, hash, rice and jelly.</p>

<p>For supper the invariable ration was bread, beef stew and tea.
For dinner, always bread and coffee, meat four times weekly,
pea soup one day, bean soup one day, and on Sunday beans and
eggs.</p>

<p>This menu is above the average for variety and quantity.</p>

<p>There are many institutions still serving bread and coffee
night and morning, and a dinner of weak soup, with more or
less meat and vegetables.</p>


<p class="ph4">Buying for Institutions.</p>

<p>In the last report of the Board of State Charities, Ohio,
Mr. Henry C. Eyman, of Massillon, makes some wise suggestions
in regard to some economical variation of the dietary.</p>

<p>“By a little care in arranging the diet list a great saving may
result. It is easy to reduce the total cost of your food supply
25%. Does that look unreasonable? Well, let us analyze some
prices. We must use present-day prices because we know not
what tomorrow may bring. Suppose you have potatoes on the
bill of fare twice daily, or fourteen times a week, the cost for
1000 persons would be at present prices, $32.00 per meal, or
$448.00 per week. Now substitute for potatoes, rice three times,
hominy twice and corn meal mush three times, your total cost
of potatoes will be six times $192.00; rice three times $6.00;
hominy twice $4.00; corn meal mush three times $5.00, or a total
of $207.00, as against $448.00, or a saving of $241.00 per week,
or $12,532 per year. Now let us substitute evaporated peaches,
evaporated apples and evaporated apricots for these same goods
canned. <i>Fruits should be used once daily.</i> The canned fruits
will cost an average of $14.00 a meal for 1000 persons, while the
evaporated fruit will cost an average of $4.00 for same number,
a saving of $10.00 per day, or $3,650.00 a year. Now you will
admit that fish is a desirable article of diet for at least 32 weeks
a year. Suppose fish be placed on your bill of fare twice a week
for 32 weeks, or in all for 64 meals. Beef, pork or mutton will
all cost about the same, or for 1000 persons $45.00. Fish for
same number, $18.00 to $20.00, or a saving per meal of $25.00
to $27.00, or for the year, $1670.00. Now, in these three items just
mentioned we have effected a saving of $16,000.00, or more than
25% of your entire food cost. The entire food cost for 1000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
persons will run between $40,000.00 and $45,000.00 per annum.</p>

<p>“It is an easy matter to take every article of food which makes
your dietary, calculate food values and prices and make your bill
of fare in accordance therewith. Entirely too much meat is used
by all of us. Beans, peas, asparagus, milk, cheese and spinach
make an excellent direct substitute. This is conservation, without
loss in heat units or even in the tastiness of the food.”</p>


<p class="ph4">Dietary in Illinois.</p>

<p>In the Institution Quarterly, published by the Public Charity
Service of Illinois, Mr. Thomas Carroll, Traveling Steward for
the Board, writes in regard to the waste which has been so
prevalent in public institutions.</p>

<p>“The lack of proper distribution, indifference as to preparation,
lack of proper knowledge of the amounts of food required,
have been chief impediments encountered in some of the institutions.
Non-utilization of food up to its fullest possibilities
has also been a serious drawback in the past.”</p>

<p>Among the defects found in the institutions were:</p>

<ol>
<li>Too much food of one kind. Entire lack of variety.</li>
<li>Poorly balanced menus.</li>
<li>An overamount of meat, occasionally an under supply.</li>
<li>Making of bones into soap instead of stock for soup.</li>
<li>Waste of fats.</li>
<li>Poor supervision in serving the food.</li>
<li>Inadequate chinaware or dishes in general.</li>
<li>Unsanitary conditions in the kitchen and in service.</li>
</ol>

<p>“With the co-operation of managers, storekeepers, cooks
and servers, nearly all these defects have been remedied to a large
degree.”</p>

<p>One illustration will indicate the nature of the service of Mr.
Carroll. “One institution which usually purchased 11,000 to
13,000 pounds of cooking oils and lard annually has not purchased
a single pound since the first visit of the Steward. Excessive
fats are trimmed from the meats, and are rendered in a
large caldron expressly made for that purpose, and there is at
present a surplus of nearly 5,000 pounds on hand, notwithstanding
the fact that every requisition for fats and oils have been
filled.</p>

<p>“By saving all bones the same institution has an excellent
supply of soup two or three times each week for the entire institution.
It is of excellent quality, superior to that served in most
restaurants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>


<p class="ph4">Dietary for 1000 Persons.</p>

<p>At the special request of the Secretary of the Society, Superintendent
Eyman has prepared for our readers the following
table, to which we call the attention of all superintendents, wardens
and managers of public institutions. The estimates are
based on the food requirements for an institution having 1000
inmates, and include the complete menu for every day in a week,
with amounts, prices and food values. This table was prepared
before the President had issued his request with reference to our
abstinence from meats and white bread on certain days of the
week. It can readily be modified to meet the present food conditions
of the country.</p>

<p>His estimate of the daily cost for each inmate is only 16
cents and thus indicates that a considerable variety may be served
without undue expense. It is not intended that any purveyor may
follow the exact program, but his suggestions are highly interesting.</p>

<p>It must be understood that in the preparation of this dietary
for a week Mr. Eyman had in mind the food necessities for the
general institution, not specializing for an establishment where
men and women are sent to repent. However, it is now recognized
that a wholesome and appetizing bill of fare should be prepared
for inmates of any home or institution in order for both
health and economy. Most wardens would cut out the Sunday
pie. Something more nutritious and wholesome could readily
be substituted. The loaves of bread are reported to weigh 2 lbs.
each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>


<p class="ph4">Expert Opinion.</p>

<p>In this connection we are glad to call attention to a portion
of an editorial from the Journal of the American Medical Association
for November, 1916:</p>

<p>“So long as it was held that a prison is merely an institution
for the safe detention of criminals, it was not to be expected that
the hygienic conditions prevailing in such a place would be in
harmony with the best experience or the newest schemes of sanitary
science. Food in such an institution was intended solely
to keep the prisoner alive and enable him to perform his allotted
daily tasks. Penal institutions are beginning, however, to be the
seats of active reform. With the acceptance of such a program
as part of the function of our prisons, the problem of nutrition
can no longer be neglected entirely. It may reasonably be contended
that good housing conditions and suitable diet do not of
themselves secure reformation of the misguided or the habitual
criminal; but without some consideration of the necessity of
proper food, the best ends of the imprisonment for crime cannot
be attained. Malnutrition may or may not contribute to the
production of criminals; in any event, the physiologic and psychic
conditions attending the lack of palatable food and a well-balanced
ration are not such as are conducive to those mental attitudes
that lead to improved conduct and more wholesome life. It has
been remarked that while a prisoner is not incarcerated for the
purpose of being fed an ideal diet, nevertheless he should be fed
so as to insure good health and a stable nervous system. * * *</p>

<p>“It seems extraordinary that so little judgment is shown
by prison officials in varying and improving the dietary. The
same unappetizing stuff is served day after day and year after
year, with no variety in food or manner of preparation. A large
number of the prisoners have stomach troubles from this cause
alone. Canned food is served when fresh vegetables would be
just as cheap. The meat is cooked to death and is covered by a
so-called sauce. The kitchen keepers are not to blame; it is the
fault of the system.</p>

<p>“<i>The remedy for this fault is to be found in the appointment
of trained dietitians.</i> So long as hospitals and other establishments
which incidentally cater to mankind have been slow to appreciate
the need of expert services in the planning and preparation of
meals as well as in the purchasing of rations, we can understand
the inertia of the prison management in this respect. But the
time has apparently come for the introduction of such efficiency
and supervision as will lead not only to economy of service but
also to physiologic well-being. If the dietary is as important as
the coal supply or the construction accounts, it deserves a dietitian
rather than a stoker or a skilled mechanic to be placed in charge
of the food problems.”</p>

<p>We have received the Report of the Board of Control of the
Michigan State Prison at Jackson. It is a pamphlet of 140 pages,
including 40 full page cuts. There are also four folders of the
farm plots. It is a report which reports. We have already spoken
of the 26 pages reporting the menu for every meal for a year.
We may learn the names and duties of the 90 officers, and their
salaries. One table gives the age, nativity, crime, sentence, residence
and previous record of each inmate. The names are wisely
withheld. The average population was 986. Twenty-five men had
escaped in the last two years. We are informed of the date of
the escape and the part of the farm and premises from which
they absconded. The date of their return is specified. Ten were
at large when the pamphlet was made up. They are confident of
apprehending these ten. They have <i>no barred windows, no locked
doors, no armed guards</i>. The men work over a plantation of more
than three thousand acres, of which 2,137 belong to the institution.
They rent 900 acres. They had 507 cattle when the report
was made, having just sold 146 steers for $14,600. The dairy of
200 cows supplies the institution with abundant milk and butter.
Horses, hogs, bees and poultry are also in evidence. “The banner
record in poultry this year was made by an inmate * * *
who without an incubator was responsible for hatching and raising
more than two thousand chickens.”</p>

<p>By no means do they confine their attention to farming. To
put a thousand men on a farm of three thousand acres and
expect them to support themselves and have a surplus is an
absurdity. There are various industries.</p>

<p>In the year 1917 they were anticipating a canned pack of
$100,000.00. Of the products of the farm “<i>they eat what they
can, and can what they can’t</i>.”</p>


<p class="ph4">Canning Factory.</p>

<p>“The intensive production of fruits and vegetables on the
farms created a surplus which had to be cared for. * * *
Hence the necessity for the canning plant. This industry
* * * has accomplished more than any other one industry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
in the prison to insure the industrial success of the institution.</p>

<p>“From the standpoint of a prison industry it ranks first,
inasmuch as the entire produce except the can is the direct result
of prison labor. While other industries require the purchase of
material for manufacturing, in the canning plant, the material,
coming from the prison farms, is also produced by prison labor.</p>

<p>“The refuse from the factory in the lines of fodder, husks,
etc., from the sweet corn; vines and pods from the peas; tops
from the beets, and pomace from the apples press, furnish largely
the ensilage ration for the large herds of cattle.</p>

<p>“The management is adding each year some new item to the
pack of canned goods, until now it includes all varieties of fruits
and vegetables, apple jelly, sorghum molasses, baked pork and
beans, spaghetti, and the generation of pure cider vinegar. (They
may soon rival the 57 varieties of Mr. Heinz.)</p>

<p>“The sanitary conditions in the factory are perfect. Any
man, in order to be eligible to work in this factory, must have
a clean bill of health from the prison physician. To further the
sanitary conditions, the equipment and entire interior of the plant
is painted white.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Consumers and any one interested may inspect this plant at
any time. Here they see the men, preparing the vegetables for
canning, in a white room, dressed in white caps, white coats, white
shirts, and white aprons.</p>

<p>They have copyrighted the label “Home Grown,” and
adopted as their slogan: “We grow, pack, sell and guarantee our
own product.”</p>

<p>Their goods are sold in the open market, being very popular
throughout the State and in adjoining States.</p>

<p>They have long ago abolished the contract system which
was really a system of slavery. They have gone beyond the policy
of raising produce or manufacturing articles for State-use, but
transact business on the State-Account plan, disposing of the
product wherever they can find a market. They claim that under
their system of employing convicts, outside labor has nothing to
fear from competition. Contract labor may have been somewhat
of a menace to labor on the outside, but these men earning wages
are engaged in honest production and the product is distributed
just as the fruits of any other industry. Let me illustrate. A man
working on a farm, in a canning factory, in a cotton mill, commits
a fault and is secluded from the community but continues his
work on another farm, in another canning factory, in another
cotton mill. He receives wages which maintains his family.
Competition is neither increased nor diminished. When the man
is released, he may return to his old job. High authority in the
labor unions has stated that there is no objection to a system
which affords fair play to the prisoner and also to the working<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
man. Laborers have justly opposed the exploitation of prisoners
under the lease and contract systems. They have not been opposed
to the development of prison industries on a fair basis. They
present no objection to a “State-Use” method, and we trust
they will not oppose the development of a few industries
organized under the State-Account plan which appears to have
been so successful in the Michigan State Prison.</p>


<p class="ph4">Fair Exhibits.</p>

<p>The products of the prison industries and of the farm have
been shown at a number of County Fairs and also at the State
Fair, and the public has thus been informed of their activities
and greatly pleased therewith. Nought has been heard but favorable
comment.</p>


<p class="ph4">Kitchen and Dining Room.</p>

<p>The culinary department is managed on the most approved
sanitary scheme. None but healthy men are employed. They use
every vegetable which will grow in Michigan, as long as the
season lasts, and the canned product when the season is over.
Every sanitary precaution is taken in the preparation of the meat
from the pasturage and feeding of the stock, the slaughtering
and handling of the carcass, in the cooking and serving the various
viands on the dining table.</p>


<p class="ph4">Objects.</p>

<p>It is not the object of the officers to exploit the men to the
advantage of the State. In the last two years they may have
returned to the State about $9,000, but in the same time they paid
out to the men the sum of $65,000 in wages. They are spending
their surplus in betterments. They have built dormitories, with
rooms, not cells, avoiding particularly the menagerie appearance.
They aim to supply the men with a wholesome and natural
environment, believing that thus they may accomplish the main
object of a penal institution which is the reformation and restoration
of the offender.</p>

Little, Brown and Company. 1917. $2.50.</p>

<p>A volume of 216 pages, containing eleven chapters contributed
by fourteen men of high repute. Judge Wadhams, of
New York City, comments on the Indeterminate Sentence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
favoring a liberal application of the principle. Doctor Glueck
and Doctor Salmon describe the necessity for psychiatrical
studies of the convict in order to determine the best treatment
for his welfare and also for the interest of the community.</p>

<p>Thomas Mott Osborne briefly delineates the self-government
plan as instituted by him at Auburn and Sing Sing, and E. Kent
Hubbard describes a similar system adopted in the Connecticut
State Reformatory. “The Honor System” is condemned and
there is no word in its defense.</p>

<p>We commend the book to all those who wish in brief compass
to know what progress has been made in humanitarian
ideals for the reformation of prisoners and what the scientific
analysis of modern conditions indicates as the best measures to
attain the cure and prevention of crime. Like other compilations,
however, the various themes are not treated with equally
judicial tone or comprehensiveness.</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Burdette G. Lewis</span>, Commissioner of Correction, New
York City. Harper and Brothers. 382 pp. $2.00.</p>

<p>In this volume of 382 pages, Commissioner Lewis speaks
from careful observation and from conscientious study. The
reader will soon perceive that a judicial treatment is applied to
the various questions involved in dealing with penological problems.
Various systems of government are considered, the differences
between the Honor System and the Self-Government
clearly indicated, and valuable suggestions made as to the classes
of prisoners to which the various systems of government may be
adapted. The subjects of Probation and The Indeterminate
Sentence are fairly presented and discussed, the author coming
to the conclusion that the Indeterminate Sentence is far preferable
to the determinate system of the older penology.</p>

<p>The tendency today is to treat the offender in much the
same way as the insane are now treated. Originally these unfortunates
were dealt with as though possessed of demons. Gradually
a reform was introduced. Special institutions were established,
and these have been gradually improved to the extent that such
afflicted persons are given such occupation and such freedom as
compatible with safety. The result is that from 20 to 30 per cent.
of them are either released as cured or may be released under the
custodial care of their friends or relatives.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis holds that the tendency to accord similar treatment
after a careful diagnosis of each case to the delinquent is
likely to produce a similar result. Each offender should be dealt
with according to his special peculiarity, the treatment aiming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
at the substitution of good for bad habits, commitment to prison
being used when it is not in the interest of the individual or of
society to release the convicted criminal. Mr. Lewis advocates
the retaining of old-established methods as long as they are of
service. These should not be discarded merely because they are
old. He claims that the leaders in the movement agree that the
new methods should be wisely tested before they are introduced
generally. It is clear that there must have been good reasons for
the adoption of any new method, but at the same time he is
strongly in favor of studying the human equation, and of differentiating
the treatment to suit each case.</p>

<p>In order to administer intelligently the large department
under his charge he has “found it necessary to proceed carefully
and to experiment widely before effecting a departure from the
well-known methods of treatment.” The processes as well as the
result of Mr. Lewis’s labors are given in the present volume. In
Part I he rehearses the fundamental social forces upon which
one must depend in order to check the development of the
criminal. Among these are the home, the church, the school,
health and sanitation, and the police.</p>

<p>In Part II are outlined the manner of utilizing the forces
likely to improve the offender; in short, all the forces of law,
order and social development in harmonious co-operation. The
book is of serious concern to all interested in social science and
in the best means of encouraging normal growth and development
through a study of existing conditions.</p>

<p>We acknowledge the receipt of the Seventy-second Annual
Report of our sister association in New York. It is a ponderous
pamphlet of 648 pages full of information concerning Prison
Progress in 1916. This Association was incorporated in 1846.</p>

<p>Our members will be interested in knowing that their Executive
Committee, like our Acting Committee, has power to
examine, and inspect all prisons of the State. Not only do they
have the power but it is also enjoined upon them as a duty to
make such visits and to report annually to the State Legislature
the condition of the prisons and any circumstances “in regard to
them as may enable the Legislature to perfect their government
and discipline.” The charter also provides that the State shall
print 500 copies of this annual report. Many additional copies
are purchased by the Association for general distribution.</p>

<p>Their working staff contains twenty officers who are engaged
in parole and probation duties, in the work of inspection
and research, in securing employment and in affording relief.</p>

<p>The last 300 pages of this document are devoted to reports
of the inspection of the various prisons of the State. The officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
do not shrink from sharp criticism of undesirable features,
and yet their criticism is of a constructive type. Recommendations
are made, and the progress made since the last inspection
is duly credited.</p>

<p>We have also received the Report of the New York State
Commission of Prisons, a bound volume of 592 pages. 328
pages are devoted to description, recommendations and criticisms
connected with the prisons of the State from the large State
Prisons to the small village lock-ups. This appears to us a
duplication of the work of the Prison Association. Why should
there be two organizations doing the same work?</p>

<p>The report of the Prison Association contains much valuable
information with regard to legislation both recent and proposed,
and to the success of the reformatory measures recently
introduced into their penal system. Those who desire copies of
the report may write to this Association at 135 E. 15th St., New

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NEW_JERSEY_PRISON_INQUIRY_COMMISSION">NEW JERSEY PRISON INQUIRY COMMISSION.</h2>
</div>


<p>This Commission was appointed according to the provisions
of a bill of the legislature of the State passed in January, 1917.
By January 1, 1918, the Commission had prepared an elaborate
report of 822 pages giving a history and description of the
prisons and penal methods of the State, and also presenting their
recommendations.</p>

<p>The historical record in general indicates a series of failures
rather than of successes in penal administration. The so-called
“Pennsylvania system,” the “Auburn Plan,” the method of contract
labor, the State-Use plan, the Parole work, the efforts at
Reformation, the partisan Boards, all have their share of more
or less condemnation.</p>

<p>The student of penology, however, will discover in this
record encouraging tendencies which may ultimately bring about
a higher type of treatment of those who go astray.</p>

<p>The Commission believes in giving the largest opportunities
for work in the open air and regards with detestation the
“<i>vicious rule of silence</i>.”</p>

<p>Their discussion with regard to the merits and demerits of
a Central Board of Control of all correctional institutions is
deeply interesting and illuminating. They have come to the
conclusion that a “system may be devised which will give to
the State of New Jersey the benefits of a centralized control of
its correctional system as a whole, but which will still leave to
the separate institutions the advantages of the personal interest
and devotion which have been such important factors in their
development.” To accomplish this purpose, they recommend the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
appointment of a Central Board by the Governor, who without
compensation, shall have a general power of supervision and visitation
of all correctional institutions. The local boards are to
be continued with authority to manage the several institutions
to which they are attached.</p>

<p>The principal recommendation of this Commission is to
advise the appointment of this Central Board with whom should
be vested the power to readjust, harmonize and improve the
entire penal system of the State.</p>

<p>As we are going to press, there comes to hand a little pamphlet

<p>Why not send our wardens who desire to do things to Bilibid?
Perhaps, it would be better to send our legislators, who
after observing the practical achievements of Bilibid may be induced
to authorize our wardens to inaugurate a sound industrial
policy.</p>

<p>Where is Bilibid? Take the train for San Francisco, engage
passage on some leviathan of the deep and get off probably
at the second station which is Manila. Thence it is a short excursion
to Bilibid, a trip taken by twenty thousand visitors in a
single year, not to mention those who take involuntary trips
thither.</p>

<p>Forty buildings, seventeen acres of ground, plan of main
building like Eastern Penitentiary, one of the best ever constructed
if we consider continual inspection as an essential
factor. 2800 prisoners there; as many others in prisons elsewhere
in the islands but all co-ordinated under a central administration.</p>

<p>The great aim is to prepare the inmates for “honorable position
in the community upon their release.”</p>

<p>There are two penal colonies on large tracts of land, on one
of which the 1200 colonists practically have a government of
their own.</p>

<p>The San Remon Farm is where the non-Christian convicts
from Moroland are confined. These war-like people have admirable
qualities when treated properly, and three-fourths of
the inmates are at work on the extensive farm without the
presence of an armed guard. Here is found the model prison
of the Orient. “Built of reinforced concrete, with grilled walls,
dormitories, shower baths, and with every modern feature for
the comfort, health and reformation of prisoners confined there,
it has proved a wonderful educational institution for the Moro.”
The entire credit for this building and the admirable system is
due to the genius and sagacity of the former governor, General
John J. Pershing.</p>

GOVERNMENT.</h2>
</div>


<p>Early in last July, a very earnest assemblage of wardens
and superintendents of prisons, and members of the American
Prison Association held a conference in Washington with a view
of mobilizing the prison industries so as to be helpful to the
government in these times of scarcity of labor.</p>

<p>There were forty delegates in attendance, mainly appointed
by the Governors of twenty-two States.</p>

<p>After discussions lasting for several sessions, the Conference
was unanimous in making certain recommendations.</p>

<ol>
<li>Already the penal institutions possess enormous acreage.
If the government will accept the product, the crops may
be greatly increased. Over a half million acres are available
and 75,000 workers.</li>

<li>In many States, where the law permits, selected inmates
can be paroled to labor for farmers at reasonable wages. Extensive
development of this method is possible.</li>

<li>Many of the prisons support industries the outcome of
which may be very serviceable. Among the chief industrial
products are socks, shirts, underwear, blankets, mattresses, boots
and shoes, overalls, harness, and army and navy equipment.</li>

<li>The executive order of 1905, providing that no prison-made
goods shall be purchased by the National Government,
ought at once to be rescinded.</li>

<li>“We are convinced that a very large majority of the
inmates of our prisons and reformatories are ready and earnestly
desirous of ‘doing their bit’ for the country.”</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>To accomplish these results, a bill has been introduced in
the U. S. Senate (S. 3076) and in the House of Representatives
(H. R. 7353) whose purpose is to utilize the labor of Federal
and other prisoners in manufacturing government supplies.</p>

<p>The prices paid are to be the market prices current in same
locality for same commodities.</p>

<p>The hours of labor are to be the same as the time prevalent
in the same vicinity for the same sort of labor.</p>

<p>The same rate of wages is to be paid to the prisoners, subject
to the necessary deduction for maintenance.</p>

<p>This means that the goods purchased by the United States
from the prisons shall be made by labor which is on a par with
outside labor.</p>

<p>No goods are to be purchased by the Government from
“any private person or companies using the labor” of convicts.
Thus the Government utters its protest against any form of
“contract labor.”</p>

<p>The Acting Committee of The Pennsylvania Prison Society
has urged the early passage of this bill.</p>

<p>Within the last two years, in the Empire State, some prison
officials and students of penology have occasionally met for an
informal conference on methods of penal management. No reporters
attend, they have no Secretary, there are no restrictive
features, the discussions are frank, free and open. They have
been held at some one of the institutions, and so the visitors have
opportunity to observe from the inside the methods and employments
of the prison where the meetings may be held.</p>

<p>Those who attend these conferences are the guests of the
institution which is visited. They have been held at the Elmira
Reformatory, at Great Meadow, at Blackwell’s Island and possibly
at one or two other prisons.</p>

<p>Last summer it was the good fortune of the Secretary to
have the privilege of attending the meeting held at Great Meadow
at Comstock, N. Y. Perhaps there were fifty ladies and gentlemen
in attendance, among whom were Jas. M. Carter, Superintendent
of Prisons for the State of New York; Warden Trombly,
of Danemora; William George, founder of the school which
bears his name; ex-Warden Geo. W. Kirchwey, O. F. Lewis,
Secretary of the New York Prison Association; Miss Katherine
B. Davis, Commissioner of Parole and Probation, New York
City, and various officials connected with the New York City
prisons and other penal institutions of the State.</p>

<p>Arriving at Comstock the guests were met by our genial
host, Warden Homer, whose conveyances soon brought us to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
Administration Building. There were excursions about the big
farm and the various buildings. Bounteous meals were served
under a tent on the grounds of the shady lawn. The ladies were
lodged in the administration building. It was at one time supposed
that the gentlemen would occupy cells in the regular prison
department, but for some reason this very interesting proposition
was relinquished, and a garage was converted into an airy dormitory
for the accommodation of the gentlemen. Prisoners
brought iron bedsteads and bedding and nothing was omitted for
the comfort of the guests. A shower bath was improvised, and
in the morning the barber and the shoe polisher appeared with
all the proper accoutrements.</p>

<p>The guests arrived on Friday morning and departed the next
afternoon. There were three informal meetings, at which a
variety of penological subjects were both lightly and profoundly
discussed. Proceedings are not to be published, hence there is
no feeling of restraint.</p>

<p>The writer trusts he will not violate the confidence of his
friends if he may refer to one or two points in the discussion.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners on the farm—by the way an ex-member
of the New York State Legislature—addressed the company
in emphatic recommendation of The Honor System as employed
by Warden Homer. He stated that the prisoners there did not
care for any extension of the self-government plan. He was
sure that Warden Homer could govern them better than they
could govern themselves. They were as comfortable as any
persons restrained within limits could be supposed to be. They
knew they could get a “square deal” from Warden Homer, and
they did not care to shift the responsibility of government to
any other shoulders.</p>

<p>An enthusiastic supporter of the self-government system was
rather inclined to look with disfavor on a benevolent despotism,
such as the system now in vogue at Great Meadow. The persons
so governed lost initiative and the power of thinking for
themselves. They had no opportunity of profiting by their
own mistakes. They became mere puppets, and were not learning
the practical lessons which would fit them for the life outside.</p>

<p>The company listened with interest to an expert dietitian
who spoke of the crude and ragged methods of preparing food
in the penal institutions. Sufficient food was provided as a rule,
but it was ruined in the preparation.</p>

<p>Mentally, morally, socially and gastronomically, we may
state, the meeting was a success.</p>

<p>Last October we enjoyed a similar conference at Sleighton
Farm, Pa., and we know of no reason why the experiment may
not be repeated in this commonwealth.</p>

<p>The Secretary is willing to suggest that there are in Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
several country clubs where such a conference would
be welcomed. He is willing to mention The Reformatory at
Huntingdon with its splendid farm, the beautiful campus of the
School at Morganza, the Workhouse at Holmesburg and Hoboken,
and the magnificent State Prison Farm at Bellefonte.
Perhaps Warden John Francies would prefer to receive us when
his institution is nearer completion.</p>

<p>When the invitation comes from any of the institutions mentioned,
there will be a response.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Utilization_of_Prison_Labor"><span class="smcap">Utilization of Prison Labor.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="ph4">BY H. H. HART</p>

<p class="ph4">(Suggestions to West Virginia)</p>


<p>With the tremendous demand for war supplies in addition
to the ordinary demand for domestic uses; with the cessation of
immigration which for 150 years has poured a steady stream of
fresh laborers into the United States; and with the immediate
diversion of a million men, and perhaps four or five millions, to
the trade of war, we are confronted with a scarcity of labor which
compels us to utilize every available worker to the limit of his
reasonable capacity.</p>

<p>Able-bodied men, working under skilled direction and thorough
system, without loss of time from drink, strikes or voluntary
holidays, ought to earn more than their board and clothes.
In the present state of the labor market it is possible for prisoners,
under proper circumstances, to earn two dollars per day. In
Vermont prisoners from the common jail are earning two dollars
per day on the adjacent farms. In Windham county, Connecticut,
prisoners are actually earning $2.50 per day at common labor,
and at Wilmington, Delaware, short-term prisoners are earning
$1.20 per day....</p>

<p>In those counties where the jail prisoners are not employed,
we would suggest the adoption of the Vermont plan under
which the jailer finds employment for individual prisoners with
a nearby farmer who pays for their labor at the ordinary rate for
free labor. The prisoner sleeps at the jail and has his breakfast
and supper there—two good hearty meals. He goes out in the
morning, carrying a dinner bucket, and returns at night. If the
distance is too great the farmer sends for him by team or automobile.
If the prisoner fails to make good or tries to run away,
the farmer notifies the sheriff promptly, who sends a deputy
sheriff after him. The reports from Vermont, Connecticut, Delaware
and Wisconsin, where this plan prevails, show very few
escapes. No guard is necessary, as the farmer looks after the
prisoners, and thus the overhead charges are done away with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>Thomas J. Tynan, of the Colorado State Penitentiary, wrote
recently as follows: “We are now doing work to the value of
$2.50 per day by prisoners on the highway at a cost to the taxpayers
of the State not to exceed 40 cents per day. The State
could well afford to pay a little wage besides the good time allowance.”</p>

<p>The difference between the old system and the new system
lies chiefly in the manner of dealing with the prisoners. Under
the new plan an appeal is made to the prisoner’s honor and good
will. After being tested within the walls, he is permitted to join
a company of workers outside the wall on his promise of good
work and good behavior, and on his promise not to run away.
The prisoners work without chains, and the guards in many cases
carry no firearms. Testimony comes from Ohio, from Oregon,
from Colorado, from Wisconsin, from Connecticut and from
Canada that prisoners—even low-grade prisoners and negroes—respond
surprisingly to this treatment; that escapes are few, and
that there is a great improvement in the industry and efficiency
of the prisoners.</p>

<p>The incentive to the prisoners to make good is partly an
increased allowance for good time; partly, in some States, a small
cash wage; partly the desire of the prisoners for the freer life
outside the walls, and partly a response to the confidence shown
in them by their officers.</p>

<p>Success in employing prisoners on the roads by modern
methods depends first upon finding a road manager who is interested
in his men and believes in the possibility of exciting their
interest and loyalty for the work. It depends, second, upon creating
such living and working conditions as will keep the men fit
for a good day’s work. That means good food, good cooking,
comfortable sleeping quarters, opportunity for proper recreation,
good laundry work and bathing facilities, and, above all, the
treatment of the prisoners by their officers as reasonable human
beings.</p>

<p>The plan of roadside camps, portable cages, chain gangs,
ignorant and cruel guards armed with shotguns and discretionary
power will not secure cheerful and efficient work.</p>

<p>[This article, by Henry A. Montgomery, Staff Correspondent of the

expensive House of Correction. What other communities or States are
doing will be told by Mr. Montgomery.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greencastle, Ind.</span>, March 13.—“Reform them? No, you
don’t reform them. You can’t change a man’s real nature. But
lots of them are not naturally bad. We get the alcohol out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
their systems, give them all they can eat, make them keep regular
hours and do a man’s work, and the good in them has a chance
to show itself.”</p>

<p>That is the way Charles E. Talkington, superintendent of
the Indiana State Farm, defined reformation.</p>

<p>The farm is situated in some of the most beautiful farming
country in western Indiana, about midway between Indianapolis
and Terre Haute. The site selected for the colony is particularly
well adapted to the needs of a penal institution, being rich in its
deposits of limestone, having plenty of tillable soil and considerable
timber. The beautiful hills and deep ravines lend the tract
beauty and make it possible for the landscape gardener with
little effort to make it look like the estate of a wealthy landowner.
Although general farming is engaged in, the products
of the garden form so great a share of the subsistence of the
men that this has developed into one of the most important features
of the work. When present plans have been realized there
will be at least 160 acres devoted exclusively to gardening.</p>

<p>It’s an unusual sight that one encounters on arriving at the
top of the long hill where is built the little village, the home of
the 700 social misfits. Two rows of long, squat frame buildings
form the “street” of this strange town. Nobody would guess
from the appearance of the buildings what they were intended
for. They resemble the Billy Sunday tabernacle type of structure.
There is nothing attractive about them, but they are temporary
quarters and they are serving their purpose well.</p>

<p>The first of these buildings is the office and sleeping apartments
of the officers. It is here that the prisoner is first taken.
His history is recorded, he is subjected to a medical examination,
his clothes are fumigated and stored away for his use when he
is released, and he is given a bath, shave and haircut, and a suit
of clothes. The clothes consist of the heavy working jacket and
trousers, underclothing and corduroy cap.</p>

<p>The first interview with the prisoner is considered important.
The assistant superintendent gives him detailed instructions as
to his own conduct and tells him with great care about the
theories that are being worked out. The number of men who,
immediately following this talk, are placed on their honor and
given as much freedom as it is possible to give is remarkable.
Few of them violate the trust.</p>

<p>Often the man sent to the farm for six months walks forth
from the office, strolls over to the recreation room to await his
work assignment and never feels for one minute the influence
of restraint, except, perhaps, the realization that in the watch
towers placed at various points of vantage about the farm there
is stationed a man—a fellow prisoner—whose duty it is to notify
headquarters if any prisoner starts to leave the grounds.</p>

<p>The prisoner eats in a dining room and sleeps in a dormitory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
which are kept spotlessly clean, and there is neither bar on the
window nor lock on the door. Each dormitory is occupied by
about 200 men, and one officer is all that is needed to maintain
order.</p>

<p>“We do not say our plan is perfect,” said Superintendent
Talkington, “nor do we make any great claims about our ability
to reform a man during the short time he is here. But we do
say this is the best manner yet devised for handling them. We
take a man from the gutter, and at least make it possible for him
to improve. We give him health, and direction enough to get
him into some employment at which he can earn his living.
Although we refuse to put forth any claims about how much
good we do for the man, we at least know that we do not injure
him. And that is more than can be said for any jail or prison.
We aren’t running any school for crime here. We do know that.
<i>We also know that we can make this institution self-supporting
and a means of revenue for the State.</i> What more can you ask?</p>

<p>“The wide-open policy of freedom, I believe, has been carried
to the extreme here. Although the great majority of men
can be handled and trusted in absolute freedom, there are, in a
population of 700 men, some who can never be given liberty.
There is need for not more than 50 cells. Any farm colony
ought to have them even if the cells are never used. Even so,
we are getting along very nicely without them, and it shows to
what great extent this policy can be carried successfully.</p>

<p>“We never had even punishment cells until a few days ago
when four were completed. We aren’t going to have to use them
much, either. Confinement on bread and water is the only form
of punishment permitted in this colony—no flogging, no dungeons,
no ball and chain, no stripes.</p>

<p>“We have prisoners living down on the lower end of the
farm working under a prisoner-foreman. We see them only
when we are making the weekly round of inspection.”</p>

<p>One could not help but feel, in discussion with Mr. Talkington,
that one was listening to a practical man who is anything but
the dreamer or idealist usually found advocating so revolutionary
a plan as the one on which the superintendent is working. He
made no claims to super-knowledge in the handling of men. He
had no illusions about the matter. He knew the faults of the plan
and he knew the virtues. When he undertook the present work,
his only assets were his experience as a farmer and school
teacher.</p>

<p>“I feel,” said Mr. Talkington, “that your officials, before
spending more than a million dollars on the old type of prison,
should see this farm and the one at Guelph, Ont. I’m confident
they would change their plans. This may be a new thing in this
country, but it is not untried in the old. The most famous of the
European farm colonies is the one at Witzwil, Switzerland. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
has solved all the problems of handling men, it pays thousands of
dollars annually into the treasury of the canton Berne and there
has been no trouble experienced in competition with free labor.</p>

<p>“The farm colony has come to America to stay, and I hope
Detroit won’t take any action which will postpone for perhaps
half a century an improvement they are entitled to now.”</p>

<p>One of the bad features of Indiana’s temporary arrangement
is the lack of opportunity to segregate prisoners into classes or
groups. The dormitories are too large and the facilities for
recreation are very limited.</p>

<p>“The men should be divided into smaller groups,” said the
superintendent, “and I believe the recreation room should be a
part of the dormitory. I would not place more than 25 to 50 men
in each group. That would give a chance to segregate the youths
from the older men and permit keeping apart the more dangerous
type from the man who is here on some comparatively trifling
charge.</p>

<p>“Another of our greatest needs is the establishment of industries
to supplement the work on the farm. We are going to get
these. There should be a furniture factory, a canning factory,
brick yard or other suitable industries where the men can be
worked when weather conditions are bad or outside work slack.”</p>

<p>The greatest factor in the maintaining of discipline is the use
of the honor system. There are good jobs on the farm and bad
ones. And the good jobs go to the men who have the best records
and have shown their ability to take positions of responsibility.</p>

<p>“You can’t tell me that you can run any prison with any such
sort of discipline,” a prison superintendent recently told me.
“There are some men who must be strung up and there are some
who must be spanked. If we didn’t resort to extreme methods at
times we would have a riot on our hands all the time.”</p>

<p>The best answer to this is found in the record of the Indiana
farm. There hasn’t been a strike or a serious riot since the institution
was founded. There are no guards standing or sitting
around idle. The guards are working foremen who perform as
much actual labor as any prisoner. The employed guards have
guns in their pocket, but the guns are never used and some of them
aren’t even loaded.</p>

<p>There is a provision in the State law of Indiana which permits
the drafting from the penitentiaries of trusties to take jobs
as foremen, sentinels and lookouts. Of course, this probably could
not be done in Detroit, because the house of correction is a city
institution. But in Indiana it assists materially in keeping down
the payroll. It makes this difference—the farm colony at Occoquan,
Va., has a payroll of about $5000 a month; the Indiana institution
gets along with $1700. And the two institutions are very
much alike.—From <i>The Delinquent</i>, March, 1917.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ATHE_CRIMINAL_CODE_OF_PENNSYLVANIA"><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>THE CRIMINAL CODE OF PENNSYLVANIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">William E. Mikell, Member of State Commission to Revise
the Criminal Code.</span></p>


<p>Perhaps, in the true sense of the term, there is no criminal
“code” in Pennsylvania. The whole body of the criminal law has
never been reduced to a written code in this state in the sense
in which this has been done in some of the States of the Union
in which jurisdictions there are no crimes except those specifically
prescribed. * * *</p>

<p>At the common law, crimes were classified as felonies and
misdemeanors. Without going into nice historical questions we
can fairly say that the term “felony” was applied to the more
heinous crimes, “misdemeanors” to the more venial ones. In
the statutory law of both England and of this country these
terms have in general been similarly employed. In the Pennsylvania
code the legislature has in the majority of cases in defining
each crime designated the crime a felony or a misdemeanor; and
following the general principle of the common law, affixed the
stigma of “felony” to the graver crimes. Viewing the code,
however, as a whole, there is an utter lack of principle in the
grading of crimes as felonies or misdemeanors, either according
to the moral heinousness of the offense, or the severity of the
punishment.</p>

<p>Bigamy, with its attendant disgrace and illegitimacy, is a
misdemeanor, while embezzlement by a servant is a felony. For
a clerk or agent to embezzle—by the code called larceny—is a
felony; for a banker, trustee or guardian to embezzle, is only a
misdemeanor. * * *</p>

<p>Administering a narcotic with intent to commit larceny, is
felony; assault and battery endangering the life of an infant, is
a misdemeanor. Blackmailing is only a misdemeanor, while
receiving stolen goods is a felony. If one in the heat of a fight,
intending to disable or maim his antagonist, should cut him ever
so slightly, he is guilty of a felony, but, if he “on purpose, and
of malice aforethought by lying in wait, shall unlawfully cut out
the tongue, put out an eye, cut off the nose * * * or cut off
any limb” of his victim, he commits only a misdemeanor. Also
if he “voluntarily, maliciously and of purpose bite off the
* * * limb or member of another,” he is guilty of a misdemeanor.
Truly, there must have been giants in those days.
The effect of these two sections is to make it a graver offense
to attempt mayhem and fail, than to succeed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p class="ph4">The Grading of Penalties.</p>

<p>The work of the commissioners who framed the Code of
1860 shows an utter lack of any consistent theory not only of
grading the crimes as felonies and misdemeanors, but also in
grading the punishment fixed for the various crimes. It may not
be easy to do this in all cases. Persons may intelligently differ
as to whether perjury should be more seriously punished than
assault and battery, and whether larceny or bigamy be deserving
of the greater penalty. But it is difficult to see why embezzlement
by a consignee or factor should be punished with five years’
imprisonment and embezzlement by a person transporting the
goods to the factor should be punished by one year’s imprisonment.
* * *</p>

<p>Under the Act of 1860, having in possession tools for the
counterfeiting of copper coin is punished by six years’ imprisonment,
while by the next section the punishment for actually
making counterfeit copper coin is only three years, though it
cannot be made without the tools to make it. * * *</p>

<p>The distinction just mentioned is, however, no stranger than
that made by the code between a councilman on the one hand and
a judge on the other, in the provisions against bribery. Section
48 of the Act of 1860 provides that if any judge * * * shall
accept a bribe, he shall be fined not more than $1000 and be imprisoned
for not more than five years. But by Section 8 of the
Act of 1874, a councilman who accepts a bribe may be fined $10,000,
ten times as much as a judge, and be imprisoned the same
number of years—five years. The statute also provides that the
councilman shall be incapable of holding any place of profit or
trust in this Commonwealth thereafter. But the convicted
judge is placed under no such disability.</p>


<p class="ph4">Relations of Fine to Imprisonment.</p>

<p>In the case of almost every crime denounced by the code
fine and imprisonment are associated. In most cases the penalty
provided is fine and imprisonment, in some it is fine or imprisonment.
In a few cases imprisonment alone without a fine is prescribed,
and in a few others it is a fine alone without imprisonment.
We seek in vain for any principle on which the fine is
omitted, where it is omitted; or for a principle on which it is
inflicted in addition to imprisonment in some cases, and as an
alternative to imprisonment in others. Thus the penalty for
exhibiting indecent pictures on a wall in a public place is a fine
of $300, but no imprisonment, while by the same act the drawing
of such pictures on the same wall carries a fine of $500 and one
year’s imprisonment. Manslaughter carries a fine of $1000 as
well as imprisonment for twelve years, but train robbery and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
murder in the second degree involve no fine, but fifteen and
twenty years in prison respectively. It cannot be the length of
the imprisonment that does away with the fine in this latter case,
for the crime of aiding in kidnapping may be punished with
twenty-five years in prison, but also has a fine of $5000.</p>

<p>More striking still, perhaps, is the lack of any relation
between the amount of the fine and the length of the imprisonment
provided in the code. In the case of some crimes the fine
is small and the imprisonment short, as in blasphemy, which is
punished by a fine of $100 and three months in prison, extortion
and embracery punished with $500 and one year. In a few the
fine is large and the imprisonment long, as in accepting bribes
by councilmen, $10,000 and five years, and malicious injury to
railroads, $10,000 and ten years. But in others the fine is small
while the imprisonment is long and in others the fine large and
the imprisonment short.</p>


<p class="ph4">Incomplete Crimes.</p>

<p>It is a general principle of criminal jurisprudence that
“incomplete crimes,” as they are called, such as attempt, and
conspiracy to commit a crime, should not be punished as severely
as the full, completed crime. It was on this principle that at
common law an attempt to commit even the gravest felony, such
as murder, was only a misdemeanor. Other codes maintain this
principle. * * *</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania code has no general section on attempts,
but in a haphazard manner, in providing for some crimes, provides
for the attempt to commit the same, and in some cases has
no provision for such attempts. A study of those cases in which
provision for punishing the attempt is made, shows an entire
absence of any theory or principle in assessing the punishment.
Thus the penalty for the attempt to commit arson is the same
as for the crime of arson itself; for the attempt to commit robbery,
the same as for the completed robbery; but the attempt to
commit murder is not punished with the same penalty as murder,
viz.: death, or twenty years’ imprisonment, but by seven years’
imprisonment only.</p>


<p class="ph4">Instances of Lack of Co-ordination in Drafting.</p>

<p>Two strikers separately determine to wreck a passenger
train: one removes a rail from the road over which a train is
scheduled to pass; another cuts the telegraph wire to prevent the
train dispatcher from stopping the train from running into a
wreck. The first striker would come within the terms of Section
7 of the Act of 1911 and could be sentenced to pay a fine of
$10,000 and suffer imprisonment for ten years; the second man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
would come within the terms of Section 147 of the Act of 1860
and could not be fined more than $500 or imprisoned more than
twelve months. * * *</p>

<p>If the executor made way with a horse belonging to the
estate, his maximum imprisonment would be still two years; but
if the butler made way with another horse he might receive ten
years as a penalty. If a mule would serve the butler’s purpose
as well as a horse he had better take the mule, for then he could
not be sentenced for more than three years; if the mule were
not swift enough, however, he might choose an automobile, for
the maximum imprisonment for stealing an automobile is the
same as that for larceny of the mule, being less than one-third
of that for larceny of a horse.</p>

<p>If the driver of a public “coachee” by “wanton and furious
driving or racing” unintentionally breaks a chicken’s leg he may
be punished by five years’ imprisonment, the same punishment
provided for attempted rape, for mayhem, for counterfeiting, and
for robbery; but if the driver of a taxicab is guilty of the same
assault on a member of the feathered tribe he is not even indictable.
If the driver of this “coachee,” while so driving, should
accidentally inflict the slightest personal injury on another, he
would be liable to greater punishment than if he deliberately
stabbed that other with intent to maim him, or wilfully and maliciously
exploded dynamite under him, thus doing him serious
bodily harm. This violates one of the cardinal principles of
criminal jurisprudence, viz., that crimes of negligence are not
so grave as crimes done with deliberate intent, a principle recognized
in other parts of the code in providing for murder and
involuntary manslaughter. * * *</p>

<p>The writer has attempted to point out in this paper some of
the more glaring and interesting defects in the code. He has by
no means exhausted them. There is a great need for a complete
revision of the code. It is a jumble of inconsistent theories; a
great many sections are badly drawn, others are obsolete; many
are inconsistent, many are in conflict; there is much overlapping
due to different acts having been passed at different times covering
in part the same subject matter, so that it cannot be told
whether a given crime should be punished under one section or
another prescribing a different punishment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AMERICAN_PRISON_ASSOCIATION">AMERICAN PRISON ASSOCIATION.</h2>
</div>


<p class="ph4">ATTENDANCE.</p>

<p>The meetings of the American Prison Association in 1917
were held in New Orleans, November 19-23. Outside of the
State of Louisiana, the registration of delegates and attenders
amounted to 261, of whom seven were from Canada, one from
Mexico, one from Cuba and one from Guatemala. One hundred
and thirty-seven registered from Louisiana. Outside of this
State, Massachusetts enrolled the largest number, thirty-two being
accredited to the Bay State. Then followed New York, with
twenty-nine, and Pennsylvania was third with twenty-two, of
whom nine were Official Delegates. It must not be forgotten that
there were many attenders at these meetings who had not received
appointment as Official Delegates, but who were active and welcome
participators in the discussions. In 1916 and 1917, the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has been well represented, but
for several years previous the attendance from the Keystone State
had, from a numerical point of view, been rather insignificant.</p>


<p class="ph4">THE PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS.</p>

<p>Dr. David C. Peyton, Superintendent of the Indiana
Reformatory at Jeffersonville, ably officiated as presiding officer
of the various sessions of the Association. He is evidently a
believer in strict discipline administered by the officials who are
legally appointed as the guardians of the offender, yet no one
who visits the institution over which he presides, would assert
that the regulations are harsh or unreasonable. His view of the
Honor System would not involve government by the inmates.</p>

<p>“In prison management there have developed two colossal
evils. One was peculiar to the past and the other in a measure
characterizes the present. Most of the evils that are associated
with prison work have come from these two roots. They are
antipodal as east and west. They are cruelty and sentimentality.
As the first was the child of ignorance, the second springs from
half knowledge and is not the less reprehensible. True reform
will come, not by a softening and relaxation in prison discipline,
not by imputing to criminals qualities which their whole activities
have proven them to lack and the very absence of which is
the cause of their incarceration, not by making their pathway
smoother and easier, nor yet by touching it with the magic of
romance. If a little of the leaven of common sense were allowed
to permeate the situation it seems to me that the clouds in our
pathway would lift somewhat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Of course cruelty, the other bête-noir, is only named to be
condemned, and thanks to our even half-knowledge it has no
place in modern prisons except in isolated spots. But I doubt if
ever cruelty was any more cruel than a regime which threatens
to become popular today. It seems to me that prisons should be
run for the purpose of training men for sane living. If that is
true, then they should in fact train these men for sane living.</p>

<p>“A modern prison should be a beehive of industrial activity
and should be <i>more than self-supporting</i>. Indeed, men should
be able to serve their sentences and earn enough overtime money
during their terms to support their dependents—in part at least.
A trade should be taught when practicable, but even more important
than a trade is the idea of inculcating industrious habits.
It is not a misfortune for men to have to labor, but it is a blessing
both for them and for us.</p>

<p>“Discipline should be strict but not arbitrary. The rules
should be based on experience and should be obviously sound.</p>

<p>“Punishment has a place in prison, but it should be logical;
should, as far as possible, flow as a natural consequence from
the transgression according to the pedagogical rule of Spencer.</p>

<p>“The industrial training should be correlated with the
didactic instruction and the prison library. The three should
form the tripartite educative force of the institution.”</p>


<p class="ph4">THE HONOR SYSTEM.</p>

<p>As was naturally to be expected, the so-called Honor
System received a large share of attention, especially in the
Wardens’ meetings. The Wardens generally are opposed to that
feature of the Honor System which involves placing the discipline
to any great extent in the hands of the convicts. The
experiments of Mr. Osborne at Auburn, Sing Sing and Portsmouth
are regarded as sporadic efforts largely affected by the
personality of a masterful, though sentimental, empiricist. Men
who have never governed themselves should not be elected to
govern one another. Mr. Erskine, of Connecticut, argued that
it was wrong to base any system on emotional appeal. “Twenty
per cent. of the men in prison are entirely bad and vicious; 20
per cent. would wield a good influence if they had the opportunity,
and the remaining 60 per cent. could be swayed by either
the good or the bad element.”</p>

<p>On the other hand it was stoutly contended that the prison
was the proper place for men to learn to govern themselves.
Necessarily they were confined to a limited area, and still subject
to watchful care by big-hearted, efficient advisers. Let them learn
that discipline in life is an essential feature of any community.
Let them learn this lesson by personal experimentation. Thus
they may recover some sense of self-respect. They will rejoin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
the outer world with some measure of responsibility. They
will return to freedom with a different understanding of life.</p>

<p>Dr. Bernard Glueck, director of the psychological clinic at
Sing Sing, asserted that in general prison officials, through limitations
to their work, were not fully qualified to pass judgment
on the subject, and had not availed themselves of opportunities
to carry out a comprehensive system of self-government. He
stated that such a system had proven to be distinctly successful
at Preston, California, and asked Mr. Calvin Derrick, the founder
of the School of Industry at Preston, to present some account
of this institution.</p>

<p>Mr. Derrick informed the Association that this California
school has developed its honor system to the point where 250 of
the boys were sent to the Sacramento fair alone, traveling
through the country 250 miles, and returning without the loss of
a single one. The boys have a complete republic system of
government, and conduct all of the work of the school. A football
team plays regular school and college teams of the State,
traveling without supervision.</p>

<p>It appeared to some of us who listened with intense interest
to these discussions that the difference in sentiment was rather
one of degree than of principle. Wherever any privileges are
allowed and wherever the trusty system is permitted, there is involved
some measure of self-government. One warden permits
the prisoners to mingle together on the base ball field. These
men are on their honor. Another warden might say that he
would allow his prisoners to play and observe games and leave
the regulation of their conduct while on the field to the men
themselves. They are still on their honor and doubtless are
aware that their regulation of conduct must meet the approval
of the warden. Suppose we allow the men to impose penalties
for minor delinquencies. The warden still exercises his judgment
on the punishment awarded. The warden governs. The
men may have more or less privileges, but they are granted by
the warden. It resolves itself into a question as to how far
such privileges may be granted. And no two wardens in the
world will agree precisely on this point.</p>

<p>For the last twenty years the trend has been getting away
from the brutality of the former systems, from the petty rules,
from degrading and humiliating treatment, and the avowed object
of confinement has been reiterated again and again to aim
at reformation. We admit that some wardens are more successful
than others in accomplishing desired results, and yet we must
not expect them to adopt an entirely uniform program. We must
make due allowance for the personal equation involved, for the
individuality of the ruling authority. The warden who claims
that his system is perfect, and that he has nothing more to learn,
is recommended for removal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>


<p class="ph4">CLINICAL WORK.</p>

<p>Dr. Bernard Glueck exhibited a number of charts showing
much that was deeply interesting in regard to the mentality, environment
and parentage of the criminals sent to Sing Sing.</p>

<p>“Sing Sing is being reorganized and rebuilt to receive all of
the criminals of New York for examination immediately after
they have been convicted. We are trying to get at the man behind
the crime rather than the crime itself. Two facts are very
evident from our work. The social fact is that 66 per cent. of
the prisoners we have received are previous offenders. The
medical fact is that 59 per cent. of the prisoners can be classified
for mental diseases or mental deviation; and thousands of this
class can be treated and cured by means of vocational training
and other modern prison methods.</p>

<p>“Sing Sing is being remodeled so that we can devote as
much as four months to an intensive study of each prisoner who
enters the institution. From this examination we can learn which
men should be sent to the insane hospitals, which to the intensive
vocational schools, and can outline the most effective method of
treatment necessary to prepare the men for the future.</p>

<p>“The indeterminate sentence is essential to the proper working
out of our plans, and the criminal courts of the State are
working in harmony with this idea. Most offenders can be restored
to a normal life and good citizenship after they have
finished a term under proper treatment, and criminal judges
in New York city tell us that fewer men come before them for
a second time since we have adopted the present methods.</p>

<p>“It is the aim of the prison to turn the men into citizens with
an understanding. They are allowed many liberties, and are
made to take an active part in community life in prison. They
have their own social organization, a system of self-government,
including even a charitable society. In their charity work they
aid prisoners who are leaving the prison, make it possible for
poor people to visit imprisoned relatives, send the bodies of
prisoners home for burial, and many other things of that nature.”</p>


<p class="ph4">PRISONERS AND THE WAR.</p>

<p>Some problems arising as a direct result of the war received
serious attention. There was the question of additional food
production by prison labor; whether paroled men shall enter the
army or navy; and whether conditional pardons may be granted,
contingent upon military service.</p>

<p>Some delegates asserted that a general restlessness was
noticed among most prisoners. Many of them are exceedingly
anxious to get into the war, and in some States prisoners are
being paroled so that they may enter the army or navy. Prison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
officials know that many of their wards are fit for military service
just as well as they are aware that other prisoners are unfit.
After prolonged discussion of the subject, the Wardens’ Association
unanimously adopted the following resolution:</p>

<p>“Resolved, That the Wardens’ Association of the American
Prison Association suggest to and request of the President
of the United States the modification of paragraph 849 of the
Regulations of the Army and paragraph 3686 of the Articles for
the Government of the Navy of the United States so as to permit
the enlistment in the military and naval forces of the United
States of men who, in the judgment of the proper military and
naval authorities, are physically, mentally and morally qualified,
despite the fact that such persons may have been convicted of
the offenses set forth in the regulations and articles above referred
to and imprisoned therefor, upon their being duly and honorably
paroled or discharged from such imprisonment.”</p>

<p>At Guelph, Ontario, the great prison has been practically depopulated.
The prisoners have gone to war, and the institution
has been taken over as a hospital for convalescents returned from
the scenes of war. The Superintendent, Dr. J. T. Gilmour, declared
that it is only a step from prisoner to patriot.</p>

<p>“We have learned a great deal about prisoners during the
three years we have been in war. We have learned that the prisoner’s
sense of patriotism is not dead because he is behind the bars;
that he is just as anxious to serve his country as the man who is
not being punished, and if given an opportunity the chances are
that he will make a good soldier. It has come to my notice that
men have exchanged prison uniforms for army uniforms in three
hours after their discharge from prison.”</p>

<p>He made the further statement that thousands of men had
been released from Canadian prisons to permit them to serve in
the army, and thousands of others were “doing their bit” by
making hospital supplies during their imprisonment.</p>


<p class="ph4">PRISONERS CONDEMNED TO SLAVERY.</p>

<p>In at least two Southern States, the infamous lease system,
whereby prisoners are leased for an annual stipend to work in
the mines or in the turpentine forests or in other work, prevails.
Isadore Shapiro, a member of the Legislature from Alabama, and
President of the Committee on Prisons, vigorously lambasted the
government of Alabama for tolerating and continuing such venal
disgrace. The Alabama legislature had made an effort to abolish
the lease system but the governor had interposed so as to prolong
the infamy. The prisoners could profitably and healthfully be
put to work on the State farms but instead they are offered for
sale to the highest bidder, and employed in mills, coal mines, lumber
and turpentine camps. All of the women prisoners in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
county were leased recently for the term of two years at the
rate of fifteen cents a day. Mr. Shapiro produced a leather strap
six feet long and an inch and a half wide with which prisoners
are flogged.</p>

<p>Recently in the State of Florida 598 prisoners were leased
at an average of $360 per head by the year. It is a fact that most
prisoners who work in the turpentine industry are so broken down
in health after a few years that for the remainder of their days
they are unfit for any manual employment. Of course it is
granted that this work must be done, but we insist that it must
be done under humane regulations. We have yet to learn of
any leasing corporation or individual that has treated his serfs
with merciful consideration. Georgia, after a long fight, has
entirely repudiated the system.</p>

<p>The Association, while insisting that employment should be
given to prisoners, unanimously adopted a resolution condemning
in the strongest terms a system whereby men and women are
sold into bondage in order to enhance the revenue of the State.</p>


<p class="ph4">THE INDETERMINATE SYSTEM.</p>

<p>There is no longer any debate about the Indeterminate Sentence.
The principle is written upon the statutes of nearly every
State of the Union, tho in a debilitated and illogical form in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Amos W. Butler, Secretary
Board of Charities in Indiana, in an address delivered in one of
the churches declared that we had brought very little understanding
to bear upon our treatment of criminals until recent
years. He compared our knowledge of smallpox, yellow fever
and other diseases with crime and concluded that we made as
many blunders in considering the offender as we formerly made
in our attitude toward these mysterious and dreaded diseases.</p>

<p>“Prisons are the visible signs of our failures. It is now
within the power of man to abolish many diseases from the
earth, and so with crime. Criminals are not sent to prison for
punishment, as many seem to believe, but prisons exist for the
confinement of prisoners for the safety of society and for the
reform of the man or woman there. They should, if possible,
be reformed and returned to society.”</p>

<p>The speaker favored the indeterminate sentence. He said
you would not send a diphtheria patient to the hospital for a
definite time, say two or three weeks. Complications might appear
and more time may be required to effect a cure. The same
is true of criminals. They should be sent there until reformed,
until fit to be returned.</p>

<p>Indiana has an indeterminate sentence law and in the past
twenty years 11,000 men and women have been released under
that law. Seventy-five per cent. of them succeeded, or made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
good. Prisoners there have earned about $3,000,000 for themselves.</p>

<p>The absolutely indeterminate sentence is not yet in vogue
in any State. A criminal under such a sentence would be sent
to prison as to a hospital to remain till cured of his malady. Perhaps,
in some cases he would be subject to some detention as a
deterrent to others contemplating entering upon a criminal career.
Specialists would determine when he was ready to enter the community.
We may at some time adopt such a system when there
are enough men and women having the skill and training necessary
to pass on the mental and moral characteristics of such
patients.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best form of sentence is by statutes which fix
the time for any given offense. The time for arson, for instance,
may be placed from two to twenty years. It is the function of
the judge or jury to determine whether the accused is guilty. If
found guilty, the defendant is placed in care of a judicious board
of control who will release the criminal at such time as they may
deem best for him and the community.</p>

<p>Judge Willis, of St. Paul, said that no physician would
send a patient to a hospital for a specified number of days or
weeks, yet this very thing is done daily by judges who send mentally
and morally sick men and women to jail. “A doctor would
not presume to predict just how many days it would take to
cure a disease, but a judge daily uses his prerogative as a diagnostician
in sending morally diseased people to jail, although the
records of trials show that no two judges think alike in the
matter. * * * Society no longer tolerates vengeance in the
criminal code. The desire of intelligent people of today is to
restore the criminal to a place in society—an honorable place—and
not only to restore him, but to make him a more valuable
member of society than he was before his incarceration.”</p>


<p class="ph4">NATIONAL PRISONERS’ AID ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p>This body is an auxiliary of the main organization. Two
sessions were held at which various phases of the work were
earnestly discussed.</p>

<p>The address of the President, Rev. James Parsons, of Minneapolis,
presented a summary of what has been accomplished,
and also some cogent reasons for the existence and maintenance
of organizations having constantly in view the rehabilitation of
those who have violated law. This address is given in another
part of the <span class="smcap">Journal</span>.</p>

<p>Rev. Charles Parsons, of Des Moines, called attention to
the increase of crime in time of war. “A celebrated doctor declared
that soon after the beginning of the war there was an
abnormal increase of crime in Germany. * * * Juvenile delinquency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
increased 34 per cent. in Great Britain when the teachers
were enlisted, supplies cut down, evening schools closed and
pupils between eleven and thirteen years of age went to work,
while a half million of the younger children had little care. The
increase of crime was so alarming, the authorities had to take
special measures of prevention. * * * Our American training
camps probably are the best supervised from a moral standpoint
of any in the world. More effort has been made to keep
them decent and free from vice than in any other period of human
history. Yet with all this precaution, it is impossible to eliminate
all the evils connected with life in the camp.”</p>

<p>Col. Sedgwick Rice, Commandant U. S. Military Prison at
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, said he had received instructions from
the war department to prepare for a large increase in the prison
population, but up to this time he was glad to state no great increase
was manifest. Many of the deserters had left some branch
of the service in order to join some other branch, not realizing
that such an act constituted desertion.</p>

<p>Wallace Gilpatrick described the operation of the Christie
House, N. Y., of which he has been superintendent since 1905.
Their work is not limited to the young men out of prison, as they
give help to all young men in trouble from whatever cause. “The
matter of employment, vital as it is, is not always the first matter
to be considered when a boy arrives at the house. Our first aim
is to have him understand that he is among friends. We make
him feel at home and we ask few questions. After he has recovered
from his first feeling of strangeness, we provide him
with a good meal, and clean linen, perhaps, a complete suit of
clothing. When he sees other young men coming in from their
work and engaged in games such as chess, checkers, billiards, and
when he has had an invitation to participate in the fun, he begins
to realize that he has gotten into a pretty good sort of place.”
The superintendent had in the last twelve years made the acquaintance
of about three thousand men who had availed themselves
of the hospitality of Christie House. It had been impossible
to follow their careers but he knew personally that 25 per
cent. of them were making good. He was sure that many more
had been successful who had not kept in touch with the House.</p>

<p>Albert H. Votaw, of Philadelphia, was elected President of
this Association for the year 1918, and Geo. B. Newcomb, Bismarck,
N. D., Secretary.</p>


<p class="ph4">STATE PENAL FARM AT ANGOLA.</p>

<p>The day before the meetings closed Governor Pleasant, of
Louisiana, in an address to the Association gave the members a
warm invitation to make a visit to the 18,000 acre prison farm of
the State, at Angola, about 130 miles from New Orleans. On
Saturday about fifty members of the Association availed themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
of this privilege. The railroad ran up the rich valley of
the Mississippi through cane fields, cypress swamps and timbered
country adorned with tropical vegetation and scenery to Angola
where we received a warm welcome. At the Administration
Building on the lawn, tables loaded with provisions were placed
to which soon our company was doing full justice. It was explained
that practically every article of the food was a product
of the farm and was such as was supplied to the convicts with
exception of the roast turkey, a few of which were kept on the
place and which had been slaughtered for our delectation. Even
the fish caught in the great river adjacent to the plantation may
have belonged to the farm by some riparian right. There was
some white bread which was not made from wheat flour native
to Louisiana. Automobiles conveyed the party over the huge
plantation affording full opportunity to examine the rude temporary
barracks where the prisoners are kept. The men eat at
mess tables and the food seemed to be ample and to be well prepared
according to the culinary arrangements usually found in
penal institutions. We saw much to admire and some things to
condemn.</p>

<ol>
<li>We did not approve of armed trusties stationed to guard
the men while at work in the fields.</li>

<li>We hope at no distant day to hear that striped clothing is
tabooed.</li>

<li>We were unanimous in condemning the system of punishing
with the lash. One northern warden, not a sentimentalist
either, offered to come down at his own expense and inaugurate
a new system of penalties in which no corporal punishment should
be allowed.</li>
</ol>

<p>We saw the men at work in the cane fields cutting, stripping
and piling the cane for the trucks or wagons. The most interesting
proposition was the huge and complete sugar refinery.
How the canes in car loads and wagon loads were carried by the
endless carriers to the huge crushers, and after triplicate crushing
the dry residuum was discharged in the furnaces, how the
juice in huge vats was subject to three chemical processes, how
the purified syrup was then conveyed, all without hands, to the
heated evaporators and centrifugal apparatus, and how the product
in the form of hot granulated sugar, six hours from the time
the canes entered the mill, was caught in barrels at the rate of 400
barrels daily, is a truthful fairy story whose details we cannot
enter upon in this report. Penal Farms in Southern States have
become very popular and successful. From the standpoint of
the reformer, they furnish better opportunities than the closed
prison or the stockade both with regard to health and morals.
The negro problem is in the forefront in their institutions; still
many of us were disposed to believe that the punishments meted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
out to those who disobey the rules are too severe and fail to
accomplish the main object of imprisonment which is to endeavor
to build up character not by brute force but by reasonable restraints.</p>


<p class="ph4">SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY.</p>

<p>The good people of New Orleans fully exemplify that genial
and gracious hospitality which appears to be indigenous to the
Southland.</p>

<p>Courtesies were extended on every hand and there was an
air of friendliness delightful and assuring to the visitors. Four
features of their cordial hospitality deserve special mention.</p>

<ol>
<li>A series of personally conducted walks to the French
quarter and other places of interest.</li>

<li>Automobile tours of the city giving the delighted guests
an opportunity to see the beautiful lawns and residences, the
parks and the magnificent live oaks, the cemeteries where the
dead repose above ground, Lake Pontchartrain and its handsome
shore resorts, the splendid drives level as the floor.</li>

<li>A steamboat ride on the Mississippi bringing into view
the immense lines of docks and the admirable shipping facilities.</li>

<li>A reception at the home of Mrs. G. R. Westfeldt, President
of a Prisoners’ Aid Society. A delightful lunch was served
by the ladies of this society. A picturesque aged turbaned mammy
dispensed pralines. The old home, typically southern, with its
wide verandas, central hall and spacious rooms, lent itself admirably
to the occasion. The company was entertained by readings,
Southern songs and negro impersonations. President Peyton
concluded the entertainment by expressing the appreciation
of the guests for these tokens of southern hospitality which they
realized was neither mythical nor merely traditionary.</li>
</ol>

<p class="ph4">FINAL.</p>

<p>Archdeacon B. M. Spurr, Moundsville, W. Va., was elected
President, and Joseph P. Byers, of Philadelphia, Secretary, for
the next year.</p>

<p>Oklahoma City was selected as the place of meeting, and the
time will be in whatever portion of October the Executive Committee
may determine.</p>

<p>In this hastily prepared sketch the writer does not pretend
that justice has been done to the many admirable features of the

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BWHAT_SHOULD_BE_THE_AIM_OF_THE_NATIONAL"><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>WHAT SHOULD BE THE AIM OF THE NATIONAL
PRISONERS’ AID ASSOCIATION.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Rev. James Parsons, National Superintendent Society for
the Friendless.</span></p>


<p>It is fitting at times to ask the questions: what is the reason
for our being, and what should we strive to accomplish? Last
year at our meeting, the speaker outlined informally one thing
that seemed to be desirable and a first step. That was to find out
as far as possible what is being done by the various organizations
that comprise our membership, and report the results at this meeting.
A survey of this kind should at least furnish a starting
point for further investigation, and possibly lead to something
along the line of standardizing the work and reports, so that it
would be possible to estimate a little more satisfactorily the results
that have been attained.</p>

<p>A statement of the nature of the investigation desired was
placed in the hands of the Secretary and the assurance given by
him that the necessary work would be done, but it was finally
discovered that on account of local duties and the call to arms,
our Secretary was unable to do as he had intended. The President
therefore at a late date sent out a questionnaire to as many
organizations as he knew, asking that the questions might be
answered as fully as records would admit.</p>

<p>Up to the present date fourteen organizations have responded.
The questionnaire did not cover all conceivable lines,
but aimed to include some of the fundamental things that are
being done by most organizations in the various lines of Prisoners’
Aid Work. These are Jail and Prison Work; Probation
and Oversight; Relief Work, and the Department of Public Information.</p>

<p>It was not expected that all organizations would have records
to exactly fit into the outline of questions. The replies showed
that no organization had kept records so as to answer all
the questions, and yet each one reporting was able to answer most
of them from records kept, which showed that the things counted
fundamental by most organizations had been included in the
questionnaire.</p>

<p>As was to be expected some had kept very few records.
Some had neglected to record facts that seemed to be considered
most important by others. In fact, one officer said distinctly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
that it had been the policy of his organization not to keep records
of anything except financial matters, as they did not wish the left
hand to know what the right hand was doing. It is manifest
on the whole, however, that there is an honest attempt to keep
a record of the vital things.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that we have not been able to secure
a complete statement of results. Only a fragmentary report
could be given of the work of one of the larger organizations,
and many others have failed to report. Then, too, scattered up
and down the land are individuals and groups of faithful men
and women who do a very large amount of work for those who
have yielded to temptation and become inmates of jails and
prisons. No account of such work could be secured, and yet
no one can fail to be impressed by the fact that a very great work
is being done. A casual glance at the figures must cause one to
realize the magnitude of accomplishments, and a careful study
of this summary shows plainly that a tremendous amount of
personal effort has been put forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>In view of present tendencies, it seems a fitting time to determine
the place such organizations as make up the National
Prisoners’ Aid Association, should fill in the field of delinquency,
and what should be the aim of our Association.</p>

<p>The work being carried on today in the field of delinquency
is complex. In the first place it was largely a matter of ameliorating
the severities that attended the life of the prisoner. The
rule was that those who had the care of criminals were brutal.
No one can read the history of prison life in past days, without
being impressed with this fact. In a general way such treatment
was considered the proper thing. Men had violated the law; they
were criminals and should suffer the severities of punishment.</p>

<p>All this has changed as the result of the light thrown on the
injustice of such a course by men who gave the matter serious
thought. They showed that instead of deterring the wrongdoer
from future crime, such a course aroused in him all his latent
possibilities for evil and caused him to become brutalized and a
sworn enemy to society.</p>

<p>It is a long road from the terrible things of the past to the
present day conditions. Every step has been contested by the
advocates of the <i>status quo</i>. Every step forward has come as
the result of insistence on the part of the advocates of progress.
Gradually punishment became less severe, the brutality of keepers
was checked, filth and unsanitary conditions were outlawed,
food became a matter for consideration, reformation a serious
consideration, allowance for good behavior, thereby shortening the
imprisonment, was introduced. The indeterminate sentence came
into being, parole for prisoners and probation for first offenders
followed. As one looks back it is a long road that has been
traveled.</p>

<p>At first it was the reformer, the enthusiast who led the way
in advocating these things. Now it is the enlightened judge, the
state officer, the prison warden and many others in official capacity,
as well as the philanthropist and social worker who champion
them. In view of this condition, is there any place for such
organizations as we represent? We answer emphatically “YES.”</p>

<p>In the <i>first place</i> it is essential that there be agencies at work
to stimulate the public to measure up to its responsibility for delinquency
and the delinquent.</p>

<p>Experience teaches that men as a rule are likely to be content
with present attainment. Our organizations are composed
largely of men who are interpreters of conditions.</p>

<p>The careful study then of facts and conditions that relate
to crime and the criminal, the discovery of the forces at work,
which develop delinquency, and wrongdoing, and the faithful
presentation of these facts and forces to the public, are some of
the important functions of a local organization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>In the <i>second place</i> there should be agencies at work to encourage
the State to do all it can through proper official agencies.
In former days the State did little. The needed work, however,
was too great for private agencies. Gradually the State has
been encouraged to assume the burdens that rightfully belong
to her, until we have great institutions, splendidly equipped and
manned. But officials are only men and a very large percentage
of them become set in their habits. A few have kept young and
have made progress, but it has seemed necessary that a stick
of dynamite such as Thomas Mott Osborne, should occasionally
be thrown into the machine, to break the crust of fixed methods
and start a new line of progress.</p>

<p>The progress made thus far by the State is commendable,
but more encouragement along this line seems essential. The
present interest in sanitation, employment, probation and parole
is encouragement, but should not the State do more to develop
the man while in the institution, so that he will be better fitted
for a successful life when released? What is the present state
of mind on this subject?</p>

<p>During the past year the University of California, at the
suggestion of Calvin Derrick, an active member of this congress,
sent out a questionnaire to all classes of institutions in the country,
on the general subject of “Control and Correction.” The
fundamental purpose of this study was to learn what institutional
heads thought of the possibility of developing in boys and
men the power of self-government that is so necessary for a man
when released from custody.</p>

<p>One hundred answers were received, and when they had
been carefully digested by thoughtful professors and Mr. Derrick,
the following conclusions were reached:</p>

<ol>
<li>“That there are a few people in institutions who thoroughly
believe in the principles of democracy and their application
to populations in custody.”</li>

<li>“That almost all the people in institutions are ignorant
of the manner in which these principles should be applied, or
could be applied.”</li>

<li>“That the rank and file of institution people are so
prejudiced against the plan that they can not be induced to
examine into it with an open mind.”</li>
</ol>

<p>If this be a correct expression of fact, the State through
her institutions surely still needs to be encouraged to put more
thought upon developing boys and men along lines that will fit
them for the duties of free citizenship.</p>

<p>In <i>third place</i>, it is essential that there should be agencies
to co-operate with the State, as there is much work that can be
done more successfully by private agencies than by State officers.</p>

<p>In caring for the prisoners and juvenile offender, there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
many things to be considered. There is the matter of employment
which is of first consideration. He must work to live. His
health, social opportunity and religious life should be considered,
and in some cases, especially among the young, his education
should receive careful attention. Another factor that enters into
many cases is likely to be overlooked. Prisoners have often come in
contact with what they call a “raw deal” from public officials.
They may be mistaken in many cases, but this does not change
the man’s state of mind. He may still need help and counsel
when discharged or released from parole, but he will have nothing
to do with the public official. Such men will often come to
the organization which works through motives of friendship. It
does not solve the problem to say that such a condition should not
exist. It is a self-evident fact that such cases do exist. We see
a condition that corresponds to this in all departments of society.
It is the same principle that causes us to have different sects in
religion, different lodges, clubs, etc. The members of each group
think that all others ought to be satisfied with their organization
and way of doing things, but men differ and express their preference
in choice.</p>

<p>We believe that the State should bear as large a portion of
the burden as possible, but we are also convinced that there must
be organizations which are not handicapped by official connection
with the man’s conviction and imprisonment for a certain percentage
of cases that need care.</p>

<p>In the <i>fourth place</i>, there should be the volunteer agency
to furnish a channel through which the citizen may wisely express
his spirit of Christian helpfulness.</p>

<p>The world needs men and women whose harmonious development
of character fits them for the best service. To permit our
noblest impulses to die for lack of expression is a very serious
mistake. No surer way to kill our desire to lift up the unfortunate
can be devised than to turn the whole matter over to the
State.</p>

<p>The story is told that a friend gave a young minister’s family
a cow in order that the new baby might have plenty of good
milk. Some time later, when the giver of the cow inquired how
she was doing, the good wife said, “Nicely, but for some reason
she was drying up. She said she could not understand how it
was as they were careful to use only as much milk as the baby
needed.” Their fatal mistake was the failure to realize the nature
of the cow. So we often fall into this same mistake and find the
springs of sympathy and the milk of human kindness drying up
because we are saving of the supply, and do not express the
natural impulses of the heart to do good and minister to those in
need. * * *</p>

<p>In view of the evident need of such organizations as compose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
this Association, what should be our aim? An extended
statement is not needful. It is plain, however, that this Association
should attempt, so far as possible, to standardize the work,
and by a comparison of results develop the most effective methods
in our chosen field.</p>

<p>This cannot be brought about at once, as the spirit and purpose
of the various organizations vary to some extent and yet
progress can be made if this thought is kept in mind. The result
of the questionnaire shows that with a little effort, all organizations
might present a fairly accurate report of many fundamental
things.</p>

<p>The second aim would naturally follow. A standardized
work with accurate reports would enable the members of our
Association to have a fuller knowledge of the results accomplished
by all. This knowledge of the greatness of our work
would cause every worker to have a more profound respect for
his own chosen task. It would also convince all men that we do
not labor in vain in our effort to save the young from the pitfalls
of crime and to redeem and reclaim those whose career has thus
far proven a failure.</p>

<p>“The city of Dallas has been repaid for every cent it has
spent in establishing the municipal prison farm,” said Finance
Commissioner William Doran, after he had visited the place at
White Rock. His reason for making that statement, he said,
was the moral effect the farm has had on the prisoners.</p>

<p>When city prisoners were worked on the streets under most
outrageous conditions, they ran at every chance and often attempted
to escape from the city jail.</p>

<p>Since being taken to the municipal farm, not an attempt
has been made to escape. Three shotguns purchased by the city
for guards have never been unwrapped. When the men start to
work they work hard, and when they stop for a short rest they
return to their work without being told.</p>

<p>“It is a remarkable sight to see the change in the men,” said
Mr. Doran; “I have watched their improvement from day to day,
and it is wonderful.”</p>
